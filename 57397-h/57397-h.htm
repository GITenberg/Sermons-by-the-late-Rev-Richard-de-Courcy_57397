<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>PREFACE<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BY</span><br />
THE PRESENT EDITOR.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following Essay and Sermons
were published, by subscription, soon after the Author&rsquo;s
death, and were honored with as respectable a list of
subscribers, as any work now extant.&nbsp; Mr. <span
class="smcap">De Courcy</span> was so worthy a man, so
distinguished a Christian, and so excellent a preacher, that we
need not wonder, that all who had the happiness of his
acquaintance, or enjoyed the benefit of his public ministry,
wished to have, in their possession, some memorial of so valuable
a friend.&nbsp; Mr. De C.&rsquo;s views of the gospel were truly
evangelical, the Parishioners of Saint Alkmond enjoyed the
unspeakable advantage of a faithful ministration of the word of
life; for, what he himself <a name="pageiv"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. iv</span>&ldquo;tasted and felt, and
handled,&rdquo; of the good word of God, the preacher, with much
zeal, affection and earnestness, recommended to others: the
devotions of the desk and the instructions of the pulpit were not
at variance; but, the one explained, elucidated and enforced the
other, wherever this great man officiated.&nbsp; The attention of
hearers, of all descriptions, was sure to be arrested, by the
importance of the doctrines on which he insisted, the clearness
with which he defended them, and the fervor with which they were
enforced: his labors were abundantly blessed; and multitudes, we
hope, will appear as his &ldquo;crown of rejoicing,&rdquo;
another day.</p>
<p>When the present proprietors (who are also the publishers) of
the work, first contemplated its republication, it was both their
wish and intention to gratify the religious public with a memoir
of the Author, and arrangements were made for that purpose; but a
friend of the deceased expressed a wish, that it might not be
carried into execution: it is therefore withheld.</p>
<p>Happy would it be for the Christian Church, if all who
officiate at her altars could &ldquo;give as <a
name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>full proof of
their ministry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. De. C. has not only ably
vindicated &ldquo;the peculiar doctrines of the gospel,&rdquo;
but he has shown, in a very masterly manner, that those who claim
to themselves the title of gospel-ministers, are the only persons
who preach according to the 39 Articles, and that, instead of
being the enemies of the Establishment, are its only
<i>consistent</i> friends and its most able defenders.&nbsp;
Having, &ldquo;cordially and without mental reservation,
equivocation or disguise,&rdquo; signed the Articles, and
declared his &ldquo;assent and consent to all and every thing
they contain,&rdquo; and being convinced, after the most serious
investigation and earnest prayer, that the doctrines of the
Church of England <i>are</i> the doctrines of the gospel, he
would have accused himself of hypocrisy and wickedness, had he
not founded all his services upon those important truths, which
are found both in the Bible and the Prayer-book.&nbsp; And, it is
asked, What churches are so well attended, as those in which the
pure word of God is preached?&nbsp; What clergymen are so truly
exemplary in their conduct, as those who are termed
&ldquo;evangelical <a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vi</span>ministers? and, What congregations are so ready to every
good word and work,&rdquo; as those who attend such
preachers?&nbsp; Immoral, antichristian shepherds scatter the
flock; the pious pastor, by his truly evangelical labors, keeps
them in the fold.&nbsp; When persons leave the Established
Church, it is, in a great majority of instances, because they
cannot receive <i>there</i> &ldquo;the true bread of life,&rdquo;
and their souls hunger and thirst after <i>that</i>, which they
cannot find, <i>where</i> they would otherwise willingly
attend.&nbsp; Let the established clergy preach the gospel, and
they will have no cause to complain of increasing Sectaries. <a
name="citationvi"></a><a href="#footnotevi"
class="citation">[vi]</a>&nbsp; Of the first edition, very few
copies (more than were subscribed for) being printed, the present
publishers presume that they are performing an office very
acceptable, to the religious public, in presenting them with a
new edition of a volume of sermons possessing <a
name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>every
recommendation which such a work <i>can</i> have.&nbsp; Here will
be found the purest doctrines expressed in the most eloquent and
glowing language, and enforced with all the ardor of the
Christian Minister.&nbsp; Feeling their immense importance, and
being fully convinced that &ldquo;the gospel is the power of God
unto salvation to every one who believes it,&rdquo; Mr. De C.
&ldquo;has not shunned to declare the whole counsel of
God;&rdquo; he has preached the doctrines of the gospel
practically, and enforced its duties evangelically; he has
rescued the scripture-doctrines from the false imputation, that
&ldquo;the grace of God leads to licentiousness;&rdquo; he has
described Christian faith, not only in its nature, but in its
effects; he has shown, how the grace of God operates on the
heart, and is productive of the peaceable fruits of holy
obedience.&nbsp; If modern infidels possessed sufficient candor,
to read the &ldquo;Essay on Pure and Undefiled Religion,&rdquo;
they must be convinced, that the love of God and Jesus Christ is
the only source of purity of morals, that every species of
morality which has not this <a name="pageviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. viii</span>foundation, is superficial in its
nature and uncertain in its operation; while he has also shown,
that the heart which is enlightened by the Spirit of God, and
purified by the Spirit of Christ, will be the seat of every holy
and heavenly temper.</p>
<p>The present Editor, who is totally unconnected with the family
of the deceased, is far from thinking that Mr. De C.&rsquo;s
works need any recommendation from <i>him</i>.&nbsp; They speak
for themselves; they need only to be known in order to be
admired; for they will always be read with both pleasure and
profit, so long as evangelical piety, fervent devotion and
genuine godliness, have any charms in the estimation of the
servants of Christ.</p>
<p><i>London</i>, <i>May</i>, 1810.</p>
<h2><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
ix</span>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following discourses, which
were found among the manuscripts of the Author after his decease,
will, no doubt, be extremely acceptable to those, who have been
accustomed to hear the word of truth from his lips, and who,
engaged by his eloquence, and won by his entreaties, have,
through the influence of divine grace, which he never failed to
inculcate as the source of all holy desires, dedicated themselves
to God through Jesus Christ, and become wise unto salvation.</p>
<p>As the copies were written delicately fair, and with wonderful
accuracy, no pains were requisite to decipher, no labor was
wanted to correct them; so that the reader has, in this volume,
the genuine works of him, whose name it bears; <a
name="citationix"></a><a href="#footnoteix"
class="citation">[ix]</a> and, whatever he may think of <a
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>the doctrines
which it contains, I am much mistaken, if he will not be struck
with admiration at the fertility of imagination, the force of
argument, and the uncommon elegance of language, which are herein
displayed.&nbsp; But, let him take heed, that his attention be
not too much engaged by the gay flowers of oratory; let him
compare what he here finds written with the scriptures of truth,
and let him not be in haste, either to censure or approve, till a
competent share of divine knowledge, and a thorough acquaintance
with the work itself, enable him to decide, with some appearance
of justice, on its merits.</p>
<p>I feel the more inclined to recommend this advice, from the
impression, which a <i>cursory</i> view of the following
discourses made upon my mind; for, wishing to pay all possible
respect to the memory of my deceased friend, no sooner was the
idea of a publication suggested, than I volunteered my services
to carry it through all its stages, not thinking, at the moment,
of any difficulties, which might occur in the accomplishment of
the design.&nbsp; Not many hours, I believe, elapsed, before I
began to consider, that some degree of responsibility attached to
me as an Editor, and that I was bound not to make known to the
world any sentiments, of which I did not thoroughly approve; at
least, not without offering an antidote for the evil, <a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>which they
might occasion.&nbsp; Under this persuasion, though extremely
reluctant to obtrude myself on the public notice, or to provoke
controversy from the Author&rsquo;s admirers, I sat down with the
determination not to let a sentence pass unregarded, which I did
not conceive to be strictly conformable to the word of God.&nbsp;
Accordingly, when I had perused <i>a few</i> discourses I wrote
my animadversions freely; but when I had read and considered
<i>all</i> with more minute attention, I found that several of my
objections were levelled against <i>words</i> and <i>phrases</i>,
and that, though I choose to express myself upon some points
differently from the Author, we were perfectly agreed in the
principal doctrines of the Christian dispensation.&nbsp; This
being the case, I have thought it sufficient to refer the reader
to his <i>Bible</i>, the standard of truth and orthodoxy; and
though, among the variety of opinions which distract the
Christian world, he may conceive it to be almost impossible to
find the road to glory, yet I will venture to assure him, the
word of Christ authorizing me to do so, if his <i>eye be single
his whole body shall be full of light</i>; Mat. vi. 22; i.e. he
shall be able clearly to discern the way of salvation; for the
Sun of Righteousness shall dispel the mists of error, and
gradually diffusing his beams over the soul, shall shine more and
more, even to the full splendor of the perfect day.</p>
<p><a name="pagexii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xii</span>As I
firmly believe, that the following discourses, read with candor
and attention, are likely to be productive of much good, I shall
here take the liberty of obviating the objections, which may be
made to one point of doctrine, which forms a prominent feature in
the whole.&nbsp; I allude to the justification of a sinner by the
<i>imputed righteousness</i> of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; This
doctrine, as it is expressed in one or two passages, might induce
a <i>hasty</i> reader to throw aside the book, and condemn it
severely as leading to licentiousness.&nbsp; But, I can assure
him, that the late Vicar of Saint Alkmond admitted no such
consequences; and I only request him to read attentively all the
discourses in this volume, and he will be convinced that what has
been written upon that subject is neither designed to set aside
the necessity of self-examination, nor of personal
holiness.&nbsp; As a proof of the former, I beg leave to refer
him more particularly to Sermon VI. p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page240">240</a></span>; and of the
latter, to the whole of Sermon II. upon the dedication of the
heart to God; in which, as well as in several others, he will
find the most forcible exhortations to maintain purity of heart,
and to abound in the practice of every good work; insomuch, that
if he should take occasion, from any thing here written, to sin,
that grace may abound, let him recollect, that he will meet the
Author before the judgment-seat of Christ, where <a
name="pagexiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>he must
render an account for his perversion and want of candor, as well
as for all his other crimes.</p>
<p>But not only upon this, but also upon other subjects handled
in these discourses, there have been, and still are, great
diversities of sentiment among divines, not merely among such as
are skilful in controversy, and void of the spirit of heavenly
love, but among others, who are warmly attached to the cause of
Christ, who labor much in the word and doctrine, and whose piety,
humility, and other graces, evidently prove that they are born
from above, and live under the continued influence of the spirit
of holiness.&nbsp; These, conceiving the several systems, which
they have embraced, to be most conducive to the glory of God, set
them forth with all the eloquence and argument of which they are
capable; and sometimes, it must be confessed, in their zeal to
defend the truth, forget the candor, which is due to persons, who
are equally zealous with themselves, and who may, perhaps, have a
larger share of that divine love, which forms the best Christian,
though he may be far from making the most able disputant.&nbsp;
That which constitutes the essence of Christianity appears to me
to be comprised within a very small compass.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
law&rdquo; is &ldquo;our school-master, to bring us unto Christ,
that we may be justified by faith;&rdquo; <a
name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiv</span>Gal. iii.
24; and faith, working by love, through the operation of the Holy
Ghost, gives us a disposition to cleanse ourselves from all
filthiness of flesh and spirit, and to perfect holiness in the
fear of the Lord.&nbsp; This, I repeat it, appears to me to be
the essence of Christianity; but, as the talents and capacities
of men are various, as there is a constitutional peculiarity in
every individual, and as education, custom, and connexions,
conspire to constitute the character, it must be expected that
truth will be exhibited in divers manners, not always in its
native beauty and simplicity, but clothed with the gaudy
decorations of human wisdom and philosophy, about which, and not
about the truth itself, contentions may arise, to the great grief
and concern of every sincere and pacific disciple of the Lord
Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>It has been thought proper to introduce the following
Discourses with an Essay, found also among the Author&rsquo;s
papers, entitled, <i>Pure and Undefiled Religion</i>,
<i>delineated in its Nature</i>, <i>Influence</i>, <i>Fruits</i>,
<i>Evidences</i>, <i>and Consummation</i>.&nbsp; Though no text
be prefixed to it, yet it seems to have been originally designed
for the pulpit, and to have been written when the subject of
negro emancipation first engaged the attention of
Parliament.&nbsp; It is unnecessary in this place to point out <a
name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xv</span>its
excellencies; suffice it to say, that every friend of <i>Pure and
Undefiled Religion</i> will rejoice that so valuable a treatise
was not disregarded, and consigned, with various unfinished
Essays, to oblivion.</p>

<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Its
advocates have not been in general either &ldquo;many, or mighty,
or noble, or wise, according to this world;&rdquo; but, on the
contrary, riches, strength, philosophy, and opulence, have
distinguished its enemies.&nbsp; Hypocrisy hath assumed its mask,
to give religion its deepest reproach, to wound it in the house
of its friends, and to arm its adversaries with plausible
objections.&nbsp; And yet, amidst all the attempts of men of
different complexions, to destroy or deny its existence, to abuse
or blaspheme its doctrines, to pervert its nature, to divest it
of its essence, or to obscure its lustre; still, religion is a
glorious reality, and, like its divine Author, from whom it
derives its origin and influence, is the same yesterday, to-day,
and for ever.&nbsp; An attempt, at least, to illustrate, if not
to prove this position, is the design of the following
pages.&nbsp; The arrangement I propose, is, to consider religion
in its <i>origin</i>, its <i>foundation</i>, its <i>nature</i>,
its <i>influence</i>, its <i>fruits</i>, and <i>evidences</i>;
and recommend it, principally from a consideration of its
<i>importance</i>, its <i>consolations</i>, its
<i>loveliness</i>, its <i>end</i>, and <i>prospects</i>.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; As to the <i>origin</i> of religion, it requires
little argument to prove it divine.&nbsp; As the very word itself
implies something that binds the heart under the strongest ties
of love, homage, and obedience to the Supreme Being; what can
produce this disposition, and give force to those <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>obligations,
but that system of infinite grace which God himself revealed unto
man immediately after the fall? which, in subsequent and brighter
discoveries, formed the basis, and invigorated the principles of
that religion, which distinguished the character of Old Testament
saints, and afterwards attained its meridian lustre under the
clear economy of the gospel, and in the lives of that noble army
of martyrs; the history of whose sanctity, sufferings, and
conquests, even unto death, is, in fact, the history of true
religion exemplified in its influence, its origin, and its
triumphs.</p>
<p>It is an established maxim of revelation, that &ldquo;all
things are of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one doubts, but the credulous
atheist, whether the universe be the result of his power.&nbsp;
But the Creator of the universe and the great Author of our
religion, is one and the same agent.&nbsp; John, i. 1.&nbsp; The
former was created and arranged by Omnipotence, and the latter no
less required the exertions of that attribute of Deity.&nbsp; The
heavens declare his glory, as Creator.&nbsp; In religion,
considered as a plan of redeeming mercy, shines &ldquo;the glory
of his grace.&rdquo;&nbsp; The firmament, with all the orbs that
move there, according to the rules of the most systematic
contrivance, and regular though amazingly swift rotation,
deciphers his wisdom.&nbsp; But it is in the plan of redemption
that &ldquo;the <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span><i>manifold</i> wisdom of God&rdquo; is more
illustriously and advantageously displayed.&nbsp; Religion,
considered as a system, applying itself to the state of man, not
as in innocence, but under the ruin of the fall, is entirely of
God.&nbsp; Man had no hand in forming it, nature no power in
executing it.&nbsp; It equally surpassed, in every point of view,
the expectations and the desert, the wisdom and power, of
man.&nbsp; Considered in its renovating and practical tendency,
as a system of morals, its origin is equally of God.&nbsp; This
appears from the various representations of the purity of its
precepts, as well as from the expressive epithets given to it in
the sacred scriptures.&nbsp; It is called &ldquo;the wisdom that
is <i>from above</i>,&mdash;the kingdom of heaven,&mdash;the new
<i>creation</i>,&mdash;the being born from above,&mdash;the new
man, which, after God, is created in righteousness,
&amp;c.&mdash;the fruits of the spirit,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; If
union to Christ be the root of true religion, and good works its
fruit, both are from God.&nbsp; &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Of
him</span> are ye in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Cor. i.
30.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are <span class="GutSmall">HIS</span>
<i>workmanship</i> created in Christ Jesus unto good
works.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ephes. ii. 10.&nbsp; From whence we may
deduce this scripture axiom; that religion, doctrinally or
practically considered, is, as to its original, the offspring of
heaven, and the sole glorious work of Him, &ldquo;<i>by</i> whom,
<i>through</i> whom, and <i>to</i> whom, are <span
class="GutSmall">ALL THINGS</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>2.&nbsp;
The <i>foundation</i> of religion.&nbsp; This foundation the
scriptures have expressly laid in the life and death of him who
was the Mediator of the new covenant, having been made, as a
<i>surety</i>, responsible for the performance of its grand and
awful stipulations.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; says Jehovah,
&ldquo;I lay in Zion for a foundation, a stone, a tried stone, a
precious corner stone, a sure foundation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isa.
xxviii. 16.&nbsp; 1 Pet. ii. 6.&nbsp; &ldquo;Other foundation can
no man lay,&rdquo; says St. Paul, &ldquo;than that is laid, which
is Jesus Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Cor. iii. 11.&nbsp; This
foundation, when it is laid in the heart by <span
class="GutSmall">FAITH</span>, which produces a dependence on the
salvation of the Son of God, becomes the only basis of the
sinner&rsquo;s hopes, and forms within him a living and permanent
principle of real godliness.&nbsp; Convinced of the evil of sin,
and justly apprehensive of suffering its awful penalty, as a
transgressor of the law, he looks for relief from his fears, and
pardon for his offences, to &ldquo;the Lamb of God, who taketh
away the sin of the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whatever is not built on
this foundation may satisfy the conscience and comport with the
religion of that man, who never saw his guilt in the mirror of
God&rsquo;s law; but every hope not founded on the
Redeemer&rsquo;s righteousness will prove infinitely presumptuous
and dangerous, and nothing give peace to the conscience, but what
secures the <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>honour of the broken law, and provides an adequate
satisfaction for the inflexible justice of Heaven; and nothing
can do either, but the atoning blood of Jesus Christ applied by
faith in that gospel testimony, which declares, that he who shed
it, thought it no robbery to be equal with God, and presented
himself on the cross a sin-atoning victim to Almighty God.&nbsp;
However, therefore, we may admit the dictates of candour
respecting some points of &ldquo;doubtful disputation,&rdquo; and
embrace in Christian love the differing parties respectively; we
can never give up the doctrine of the atonement, without yielding
up to our adversaries, at the same time, the very essence of
truth, the glory of the gospel, and the only foundation of our
hopes and prospects for ever.&nbsp; Nay, we may boldly affirm,
that the scheme of religion that is not formed upon this plan,
wants every thing essential to the glory of the divine
perfections, and every thing that can consistently secure the
peace and salvation of man, as a sinner.&nbsp; All the opponents
of this truth, who choose to discriminate themselves by names
flattering to their pride, or declarative of their attachment to
some stale and long-exploded heresy, are in the same predicament
with Jews and Greeks; the basis of whose religion was pride and
self-righteousness.&nbsp; What men call natural religion,
rational religion, or <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>New Jerusalem doctrine&mdash;those
pompous schemes of human contrivance, emblazoned with glittering
epithets to catch the unwary, and only suited to the wild fancy
of visionaries and deists&mdash;I say, what men thus call
religion, if not founded on the propitiation and righteousness of
the Son of God, is the religion of Satan, and must lead to his
kingdom.&nbsp; For, how that system, which leaves out the
infinite virtue of the death of Jesus, as an expiation for sin,
can ever bring a man to heaven, I cannot conceive, when I find it
written, &ldquo;there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin,&rdquo;
when that is denied or degraded, &ldquo;but a certain fearful
looking-for of judgment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Heb. x. 26, 27.&nbsp; So
that, as true religion is in its origin of God, who planned its
system, and plants its celestial seed in the heart; so, in its
foundation, it is equally divine, being built on the knowledge of
Christ crucified, and &ldquo;through faith in his
blood.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. iii. 25.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The <i>nature</i> and <i>influence</i> of religion
demand our next consideration.&nbsp; To judge accurately both of
the one and the other, it will be necessary to abstract whatever
is circumstantial, external, nominal, or adventitious, and to
confine our ideas to that which is essential and intrinsic.&nbsp;
And in this disquisition, we only act by the same rule, which we
observe when forming a judgment of the real worth of an
individual.&nbsp; <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>We leave out the accidents of birth, office, titles,
fortune, and form our idea of the man from his mind, from the
state of his heart, from his virtuous excellence.&nbsp; Any other
mode of forming an estimate of characters in a moral point of
view, only tends to confound our ideas, and leads to a servile
admiration of what is neither great nor excellent in itself:
which lays the foundation of all the false homage men often pay
to profligacy and meanness, because they happen to be titled and
rich.&nbsp; Apply this to religion.&nbsp; We cannot form a true
estimate of its nature from the pomp and dignities with which the
profession of it is invested in some of its ostensible patrons;
nor from any external forms, however excellent in themselves, if
men rest in them, and go no farther.&nbsp; Forms no more
constitute religion, than the external trappings of rank and
retinue constitute the man.&nbsp; On the contrary, St. Paul
classes with the very worst of characters, those, &ldquo;who have
only the form of godliness, but deny its
<i>power</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2 Tim. iii. 5.&nbsp; So does the
prophet Isaiah, when describing those who &ldquo;drew nigh to God
and honoured him with their lips, while their <i>hearts</i> were
<span class="GutSmall">FAR FROM</span> him,&rdquo; Isa. xxix. 13;
though in the language of pomp and delusion they vainly boasted,
&ldquo;The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord are
these.&rdquo;&nbsp; True religion is the religion of the <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span><i>heart</i>.&nbsp; For God is a spirit; and they who
worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.</p>
<p>Solomon describes its nature, when he demands, in the name of
Jehovah, &ldquo;My son, give me thy <i>heart</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Prov. xxiii. 26.&nbsp; So does St. Paul, who says, &ldquo;The
kingdom of God is not meat and drink,&rdquo; does not consist in
outward things, &ldquo;but is righteousness, peace, and joy in
the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. xiv. 17.&nbsp; And again, when
endeavouring to undeceive the Jews, who were blind on this very
point, he says, &ldquo;He is not a Jew who is one outwardly,
neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh: but
he is a Jew who is one <i>inwardly</i>, and circumcision is that
of the <i>heart</i>, in the spirit, not in the letter, whose
praise is not of men but of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. ii. 28,
29.&nbsp; Forms may be excellent; the means of grace are
necessary, and of divine institution.&nbsp; They are however but
means, and operate, through the blessing of God, as the
transparent medium does, which admits the light of the sun into a
place of worship.&nbsp; But he who rests in them, and supposes a
regular attendance upon them to be the whole of what is required
in religious homage, thinks and acts as absurdly as a man, who,
trusting to a transparent medium still to give him light, after
the sun had quitted the horizon and ceased to illuminate the
hemisphere, <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>should find himself involved in the darkness of
night.&nbsp; A sad but true emblem of the situation of the
sinner, whose heart is not given up to God and changed by his
grace; who sits down contented with the formalities of religion,
though in the &ldquo;region and shadow of death,&rdquo; till
death dissolves the delusion, and consigns him to the blackness
of darkness for ever.</p>
<p>When we say that religion is the religion of the heart, we
mean to extend our description of its nature far beyond outward
form, or mere moral decency.&nbsp; Religion includes morality,
but it comprehends <i>much more</i>.&nbsp; A sinner may be
outwardly moral, and inwardly immoral, as the pharisees were,
full of self-righteousness, pride, love of the world, and
hypocrisy.&nbsp; The civilization produced by morality alone, is
like the whiting of a sepulchre, which is full of rottenness
<i>within</i>.&nbsp; Our Lord&rsquo;s advice to such characters
among the Jews, was, &ldquo;cleanse <i>first</i> that which is
<span class="GutSmall">WITHIN</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The essential
characteristics of the religion of the heart, are <i>faith</i>,
<i>humility</i>, and <i>love</i>: the first of these graces,
leading the renewed sinner to eye nothing for the justification
of his person before God, or the peace of his conscience, but the
complete work of Jesus finished on the cross; the second, making
him abhor himself and repent as in dust and ashes; <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>and the
third, prompting him to love, with a supreme and ardent
affection, that gracious God, who hath loved him in his Son; and
to whom, from that sacred and noble principle, he wishes heart
and life to be solemnly and unreservedly consecrated.&nbsp; But,
in the religion of a mere moralist, these three graces make no
constituent part.&nbsp; <i>His</i> faith is dead, being made up
of speculation, and some general notions, without any regard to
the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; His humility, if he pretend
to any, is feigned, or consists in condescending to let the
Redeemer have a <i>share</i> in the honour of his
salvation.&nbsp; And his love, having no gospel root, is servile,
or imaginary, or absolutely false, not springing from a sense of
the pure love of God to sinners in his crucified Son.&nbsp; In
short, he has every thing of religion but its essence.&nbsp; And,
wanting that, nothing remains in his possession to boast of, but
the shadow, and the form; whereas, religion itself is a sacred
flame kindled at the cross of Christ; which, while contemplating
the love that bound him there, has, like the living creatures in
St. John&rsquo;s vision, Rev. iv. &ldquo;eyes within,&rdquo; to
view with sorrow the fallen and guilty nature, which requires his
blood to cleanse it, and his love to conquer.&nbsp; A sight that
softens the heart, and diffuses throughout all its powers a sense
of the love of God, the strongest incentive <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>to gratitude
and obedience.&nbsp; Hence, a celebrated Christian poet of our
own says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Talk they of morals?&nbsp; O thou bleeding
love!<br />
Thou Maker of new morals to mankind!<br />
The grand morality is love of thee!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4.&nbsp; In describing the <i>influence</i> of religion, we
mean not to extend it so far as to suppose it extirpates every
vestige of the fall, or destroys all the relicks of human
frailty.&nbsp; It is not the religion of angels, nor of
&ldquo;the spirits of just men made perfect,&rdquo; but the
religion of the soul imprisoned in the body, and embarrassed by
that enclosure, in the exertion of its faculties, that is the
subject of our consideration.&nbsp; It is the religion of
sinners, saved by grace; and, as sinners, to the very last moment
of life, depending upon grace alone: in whom, amidst their
various conflicts, and numberless infirmities, it nevertheless
produces the most surprising effects.&nbsp; Observe its influence
on the heart of a sinner.&nbsp; It softens what was obdurate as
the rock, and fixes what was inconstant as the wind; arrests the
fugitive in his flight from the ways of God, and brings the once
profligate prodigal back to his father&rsquo;s house with a heart
pierced with sorrow for past transgressions, and more deeply
still by a sense of the love that pardons them.&nbsp; It makes
the stout-hearted tremble before the majesty and <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>power of
Jehovah, and constrains the abandoned to give up the most beloved
lusts.&nbsp; It produces greater wonder still, in obliging the
pharisee to give up his self-righteousness, and the formalist to
trust no longer in his forms.&nbsp; It can light up a sacred
flame in the breasts that had been frozen with formality, and
dilate with sentiments of pure benevolence a heart long
contracted by self-complacency or worldly-mindedness.&nbsp; It
bursts the bonds of the captive who had been &ldquo;tied and
bound with the chain of his sins;&rdquo; and makes the
self-conceited rationalist, who is no less a captive than the
profligate, to sit down, Mary-like, at the feet of Jesus, in the
character of a pupil, a novitiate, a fool.&nbsp; It pours the
balm of comfort into the breast of the afflicted, tempted
mourner, and makes &ldquo;the bones that had been broken to
rejoice.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. li.&nbsp; What was it that so
instantaneously stopped Saul in his career of cruelty and
persecution, and changed a blasphemer into a preacher of the
faith, which once he destroyed?&nbsp; What was it that brought
Magdalen, a prostitute, to bathe the feet of Jesus with tears of
penitence and joy, and to wipe them with the hairs of her
head?&nbsp; What was it that tore Zaccheus from an occupation of
worldly-mindedness and extortion, and disposed him to make
restitution, and to give half his goods to the poor?&nbsp; What
was it that made <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Paul and Silas sing praises to God, though smarting
under the lashes they had received, and when confined to a
loathsome prison? that kept Stephen composed, and filled him with
rapturous views of the glory of God, even when his murderers were
taking his life; and that enabled those pious heroes of
antiquity, mentioned in the Epistle to the Hebrews, to perform so
many wonders?&nbsp; It was the <i>sovereign</i> influence of
religion in the first instance, its <i>softening</i> and
<i>converting</i> power in the second, its <i>expanding</i>
efficacy in the third, and its <i>victorious</i> operation in the
last.</p>
<p>Mark the influence of religion on society.&nbsp; It is the
grand cement of pure and permanent friendship among individuals;
is the great preservative against disorder and discord in
families; is the sacred bond of union in the assemblies of the
righteous; the only safe guarantee of the faith of nations; the
healer of divisions; the sovereign peace-maker between contending
parties; and the most powerful antidote against strife,
animosity, and revenge, and all the other vindictive and
turbulent passions, that disquiet the breasts of individuals,
break the bonds of domestic tranquillity, or disturb the peace of
nations.&nbsp; &ldquo;From whence come wars and fightings among
you?&rdquo; says St. James: From religion?&nbsp; No, from the
want of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come they not <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>hence? even from your lusts that war
in your members.&rdquo;&nbsp; Were religion but universally
known, and the empire of the Prince of Peace as extensive as the
dominion of pride and secular power, of ambition and revenge, we
should then see all the belligerent powers of the earth
&ldquo;beat their swords into plough-shares, and their spears
into pruning-hooks,&rdquo; and wars of every kind cease for
ever.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The <i>evidences</i> of religion.&nbsp; Religion,
when possessing its sacred empire in the heart, is in scripture
called by different names, according to the different faculties
which it governs, or the passions respectively which it
controls.&nbsp; In the understanding, it is light; in the
affections, love; in the will, acquiescence and submission.&nbsp;
In the passions of the renewed mind, it is the fear of the Lord,
which is the beginning of wisdom; the hope that maketh not
ashamed; the joy that is unspeakable and full of glory; the holy
shame that covers the soul with overwhelming awe in a view of the
presence and condescension of God; the peace that passeth all
understanding.&nbsp; Under crosses, it is patience; under
affronts and injuries, meekness; under persecution and losses for
Christ&rsquo;s sake, fortitude and resignation; in prosperity,
humbleness of mind; in adversity, spiritual support; in death,
triumph.&nbsp; Considered in a complex point <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>of view,
either as implying the commencement of the divine power that
produces, or the progressive influence of the grace that
advances, that assemblage of the fruits of the Spirit, which form
religion into a sort of bright constellation; it is, the new
birth, sanctification, the divine life, the image of God
restored, the soul&rsquo;s union to Christ, and a growing
meetness for the everlasting inheritance of the saints in
light.</p>
<p>Religion, when it can produce tempers so sacred, and so
benign, must necessarily display its nature in a course of
external evidence before the world.&nbsp; Being in its effects
&ldquo;pure,&rdquo; and preserving him who is the subject of it
&ldquo;undefiled&rdquo; from the corruptions that are in the
world, it must necessarily teach us to live &ldquo;righteously,
soberly, and godly,&rdquo; amidst every temptation to injustice,
intemperance, and impiety, to which we are every day exposed; as
well as provide for the laws by which every relation in social
life ought to be governed, from the prince and subject, down to
the very lowest ranks of subordinate characters.&nbsp; But let us
attend to the particular evidence adduced by St. James.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Pure religion and undefiled before God, even the Father,
is this; to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,
and to keep himself unspotted from the world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of all
the situations, which the calamities of life distinguish among <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>the sons and
daughters of affliction, none could be more to the
apostle&rsquo;s purpose, than that of the orphan and the widow;
and none more apposite, as an evidence of true religion, than to
visit <i>such</i>.&nbsp; The state of the orphan is greatly to be
pitied, as being destitute of the guide of his youth, and
deprived by a premature stroke of him, to whom nature directs him
to look up as to his guardian and support; in a world too, in a
passage through which, youth stands so much in need of all that a
wise and tender father can do for his offspring.&nbsp; The widow
is an object of still greater commiseration; who, besides the
affliction of having been bereft of her dearest earthly friend,
is left to struggle alone with the difficulties of a family and
of the world, to educate with maternal solicitude the party that
became an orphan by the same calamity which made her a widow, and
to suffer an affliction, which is the more poignant, as her sex,
age, and the tender relation in which she had been placed, would
contribute to make her feel more sensibly the loss, to which the
orphan seldom adverts.&nbsp; These are the parties, whom pure and
undefiled religion enjoins us to visit; not for the purpose of
mere form or curiosity, but for the purpose of administering
actual relief, and mingling with the acts of beneficence the
counsel and consolations, which the religion of Jesus
inspires.&nbsp; But <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>how few love to make <i>such</i> visits! and how fewer
still, to make them in <i>this</i> style!&nbsp; Had our apostle
made it a mark of religion to frequent scenes of dissipation, to
run the round of worldly pleasure, to mix with each convivial
assembly, and to visit only the house of laughter and levity,
what multitudes would put in their claim to religion and to the
recompense annexed to it!&nbsp; But let not the sons and
daughters of dissipation deceive themselves.&nbsp; Religion seeks
different society, loves different pleasures, visits the abodes
of wretchedness and sorrow, and prefers the house of mourning,
where it can shew its sympathy, impart its benefits, and learn
lessons suited to the condition of suffering and short lived
humanity, above all the gilded scenes of earthly splendor.&nbsp;
And we may be bold to say, that if the pleasure-taker could, from
the highest style of sensual indulgence, prove, that he tasted
delight in any degree equal to that, which <i>he</i> feels, who
makes the &ldquo;widow&rsquo;s heart to dance for joy;&rdquo; we
would then leave him in peaceable possession of the amusements
that engross his time.&nbsp; But as he can never possibly prove
it, we must mortify him in the midst of his gratifications, by
telling him, that he who liveth in pleasure is &ldquo;dead while
he liveth;&rdquo; dead to the life of religion and to the offices
of real humanity; and that there is an <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>awful day approaching, in which the
Judge of heaven and earth shall say to sinners of a certain
description, &ldquo;In as much as ye did it not to one of the
least of these, ye did it not unto me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But humanity and charity do not constitute the whole of
religion.&nbsp; Something more is required; and that is, that a
man &ldquo;keep himself unspotted from the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The christian character, or the conversation of a true believer,
is, according to scripture metaphor, represented under the emblem
of a white garment; the color denoting purity and glory.&nbsp;
They who walk consistently with their profession, are described
as not sullying the purity of it.&nbsp; So our Lord says of some
in the church of Sardis, &ldquo;Thou hast a few names even in
Sardis, which have not defiled their garments, and they shall
walk with me in white, for they are worthy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rev.
iii. 4.&nbsp; Perhaps the allusion in both places is made to the
custom of arraying, as the word signifies, all candidates for
offices, as among the Romans, in white robes.&nbsp; Christians
are candidates for glory.&nbsp; They are adorned in the white
garment of Christ&rsquo;s righteousness for their justification
before God; Rev. iii. 5; and they wear the sacred robe of
personal holiness, as the justification of their character before
men.&nbsp; The former is incapable of defilement, and is that <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>&ldquo;fine
linen, clean and white, in which the bride, the Lamb&rsquo;s
wife,&rdquo; is to be adorned in the grand solemnization of her
nuptials in the last day.&nbsp; The latter, when under the
inspection of omniscience, and compared with the extensive purity
of the law, requires to be &ldquo;washed and made white in the
blood of the Lamb.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rev. viii. 14.&nbsp; It is this
last robe, the Christian&rsquo;s walk and character, which it is
incumbent upon him to keep unspotted from the world.&nbsp; And as
a white garment shews any accidental defilement on it sooner and
more conspicuously, than one of a different color; this
application of the emblem points out the greater necessity of
watching against every inconsistency, that would disgrace his
profession and bring his character into suspicion.&nbsp; The
world watches for his halting, and will be ready upon every
occasion to impute faults where there are none, and to aggravate
and triumph in real ones.&nbsp; If defamation, false charges,
misrepresentations, untruths, could really blot the
Christian&rsquo;s garment, it would be never white.&nbsp; But the
blackening of the wicked in this respect, is all their own.&nbsp;
Happy and blessed the Christian, who, when &ldquo;the world says
all manner of evil of him,&rdquo; proves by his conduct, that it
is &ldquo;falsely for Christ&rsquo;s sake.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it is
not from hence that his principal danger arises.&nbsp; The world
is less to be feared when it frowns, <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>than when it smiles; and many a
professor, who has stood firm in the midst of opposition, has
been hugged to death by caresses.&nbsp; In short, he, who is
truly wise, will consider the world as a hostile country, in
which the enemy of his soul has spread ten thousand snares for
the purpose of alluring to destruction.&nbsp; The whole armour of
God, and all the power of grace, will be requisite to guard and
keep him amidst such innumerable dangers as compass him
about.&nbsp; The power, which the world has of accommodating its
baits and changing its temptations, will demand the exertion of
every grace of the christian soldier.&nbsp; His experience will
instruct him when to resist, and when to flee; when to exercise
caution, and when to summon up fortitude.&nbsp; Sometimes he will
be in danger of loving the world; at other times, of fearing it
too much.&nbsp; &ldquo;The course of this world&rdquo; being
totally opposite to the word of God, and its principles, maxims,
and amusements, tending to promote error, vanity, and sin, he
will often recollect the words of Solomon, &ldquo;Can a man take
fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?&nbsp; Can one
go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?&nbsp; So he that
goeth in to his neighbour&rsquo;s wife; whosoever toucheth her,
shall not be innocent.&rdquo;&nbsp; Prov. vi. 27, 29.&nbsp; And
he will pray with David, &ldquo;Keep back thy servant from
presumptuous sins, let <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>them not have dominion over me, then
I shall be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great
transgression.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. xix. 13.&nbsp; The words of St.
Paul too, warn and animate him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come out from among
them, and be ye separate, and touch not the <i>unclean thing</i>,
and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye
shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord
Almighty.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2 Cor. vi. 17, 18.</p>
<p>But it is not only from the spots of gross criminality, or the
commission of flagrant offences, that religion teaches us to keep
ourselves pure and undefiled.&nbsp; Even the smallest approaches
to these, or a <i>temptation</i> to any, in the secret workings
of inward depravity, give the Christian infinitely more pain,
than acts of injustice do the fraudulent; a life of unremitted
excess, the licentious; or adultery, that epitome of all
villanies, the wretch, who, by committing it, gives the most
deadly stab to his own reputation, and the deepest wound to his
neighbour&rsquo;s peace.&nbsp; An idea in the imagination, a
thought, a word, any sudden sally of unguarded temper, that
cannot be justified or harboured, without grieving the Holy
Spirit, and violating truth, will give him pain, and excite
resistance, and produce humiliation.&nbsp; The conscience of the
believer being &ldquo;cleansed from dead works to serve the
living God,&rdquo; is susceptible of the <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>slightest
spot; while that, which is totally defiled by long accumulated
guilt, feels no uneasy sensation, and sees not its own
pollution.&nbsp; Being made the seat of sensibility as well as of
purity, the conscience, though wounded with even a slight
offence, is like the tender organ of the eve, when only a mote
incommodes or lacerates its delicate texture.&nbsp; It makes him
weep, and robs him of repose, till that blood which washes out
the deepest or the slightest stain of sin, and that Spirit who
subdues its power, renew their respective and sovereign
influence.&nbsp; This guard against the access of inward
defilement, and this gospel mode of cleansing it, are the only
safe preservatives from grosser corruptions.&nbsp; Therefore, as
the heart, like tinder, is too susceptive of the sparks of
temptation, he shuns the converse of those, through whom he might
be drawn aside; thinking his character too sacred to be
habitually mixed or trusted with the company of the gay and
irreligious; and his peace too precious, to be lost by what, in
review, must often give so much pain, without the smallest real
advantage.&nbsp; Even if there were no other argument to enforce
the necessity of keeping ourselves unspotted from the world, this
is sufficiently strong and alarming; that that very world, by a
sinful conformity to which, men contract guilt and risk
salvation, <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>after having acted as <i>tempter</i>, will, like Satan,
be the very first to turn <i>accuser</i>, and
<i>tormentor</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>consolations</i> of religion.&nbsp; When we recommend
the consolations of religion, as an argument to engage men to
enter upon the experience and practice of it, we cannot so far
delude their hopes, as to insinuate, that it excludes every idea
of trouble and conflict, as well as every sensation of sorrow and
solicitude.&nbsp; As compared to a warfare, a pilgrimage, a race,
religion must, of course, presuppose enemies, who cannot be
overcome without fighting; a journey, that cannot be undertaken
and completed without difficulties; and a prize, which cannot be
won by indolence and inaction.</p>
<p>Every science and art is attended with difficulties; and
nothing that is useful and ornamental in the business of life can
be acquired without study, and toil, by which the value and
pleasure of the acquisition are proportionably increased.&nbsp;
Can any persons, then, reasonably expect, that in a world lying
in the wicked one, they should meet with no opposition? in a body
of sin and death, they should feel no conflicts? that their peace
should remain undisturbed by any annoyance from Satan? that no
thorns should perplex their path in a wilderness, in which
nothing naturally grows but sorrow, sin, and care? and that their
head should be hereafter adorned with <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>an immortal crown, without sustaining
one previous cross, or making one sacrifice in their way to
it?&nbsp; They cannot suppose this.&nbsp; The great Author of
religion says, &ldquo;Except a man deny himself, take up his
cross and follow me, he cannot be my disciple.&nbsp; Strive to
enter in at the strait gate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet, to encourage the
diffident, and fix the resolution of the hesitating and the
timid, an apostle assures us, that God &ldquo;hath given
everlasting consolation and good hope through grace&rdquo; to all
believers in Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord himself says, &ldquo;As one whom his mother
comforteth, so will I comfort you.&nbsp; In the world you shall
have tribulation; but in me, you shall have peace.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The unhappiness of mankind arises in general from five principal
causes; from guilt in the conscience, tyranny in the passions,
want of real enjoyment in what they possess, want of spiritual
resource under affliction, and an inordinate love of life, which
makes death terrible, and even the thought of it the most
imbittering intruder into the human breast.&nbsp; But against all
this mass of wretchedness, religion provides an antidote.&nbsp;
If we know and follow Christ, he will bring the peace which he
purchased on the cross, into our conscience; he will sanctify and
govern our passions, and make our heart the seat of his peaceful
dominion; the enjoyment of his &ldquo;favor, which is better <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>than
life,&rdquo; will give a sacred zest to ordinary comforts, and
fill up in our soul, a void, which the whole world cannot
satisfy; he will keep us resigned amidst the cares of life, and
tranquil in the prospect of its awful close.&nbsp; Life shall
have no real bitterness; sin, no dominion; the smiling world, no
real charms; and death, no real sting, when we can say, &ldquo;My
beloved is mine, and I am his.&rdquo;&nbsp; Under crosses and
adversity, we shall never want a spring of comfort in the
salvation of Jesus, nor want a friend, when interested in the
love of Him, who drank up the dregs of inexpressible sorrow, that
we might partake of the richest ingredients in the cup of gospel
consolation.&nbsp; However chequered our scene of life may be in
the dispensations of Providence, being made up of joys and
sorrows, hopes and fears, crosses and comforts, his grace will
enable us to adopt the language of primitive Christianity, and
say, &ldquo;We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed;
perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast
down, but not destroyed; as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as
having nothing, and yet possessing all things.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2
Cor. iv. 8, 9.&nbsp; &ldquo;As tribulation aboundeth, our
consolations in Christ shall much more abound.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
as they flow from a source, which is as perennial as it is pure,
and are founded upon a basis as firm as the covenant <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>and oath of
Jehovah, can any language describe the happiness of true
religion, when its real votaries can pronounce in faith and
experience, the two following sentences of sacred writ?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh
for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory.&nbsp; We
<i>know</i> that when the earthly house of this tabernacle is
dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with
hands, eternal in the heavens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>loveliness</i> of religion.&nbsp; Another and most
powerful allurement into the ways of religion, is the
<i>loveliness</i> of its character in those who adorn its
profession.&nbsp; St. Paul ranks &ldquo;whatsoever things are
<i>lovely</i> with whatsoever things are true, honest, just,
pure, and of good report.&rdquo;&nbsp; Phil. iv. 8.&nbsp; And, as
true religion is the work of Christ, delineates his image, and is
one of the brightest emanations from the glory of the Sun of
righteousness, we may say of it, as of its divine Author, that it
is &ldquo;altogether lovely.&rdquo;&nbsp; In regulating our
opinion, and dilating our ideas on this subject, some caution is
necessary, lest we mistake counterfeits for the original, and
fall in love with appearances, or even with deformity.&nbsp;
Whatever hopes we may entertain of the existence of religion in
the hearts of some, who profess it, under great disadvantages,
arising from natural temper, prejudices of education, <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>weakness of
capacity, or rusticity of manners; it is not from such that we
are to form our idea of what is amiable.&nbsp; Still less are we
to draw the portrait from the impertinent sallies of juvenile
profession; from the affected look of solemn ignorance; from the
affectedly sanctimonious aspect, with all the pharisaic
contorsions of features and the grimaces that form it, an apology
often for want of genuine sanctity within; not from the starched
behaviour and rigid manners, that excite contempt and confirm
prejudices; not from the insufferable pomp of illiteracy,
assuming the dictator&rsquo;s air, and demanding all that
respect, which an humble sense of deficiencies would procure; not
from the forbidding brow and sour-address, those terrific guards
that some plant around their persons, lest you should approach
too near, or make too free with their self-consequence; not from
the unfortunate manners of those, who behave as if they thought
there should always subsist an irreconcilable variance between
the character of a gentleman and that of a Christian; not from
the false fire of those, who make an abrupt remark, a haughty
air, a pert censure, the marks of religious zeal, and seem to
have no more idea of prudence, than if the word was not to be
found in the Bible, and the grace itself constituted no part of
the christian character.&nbsp; All <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>these blemishes in religious
profession have nothing to do with the loveliness of religion,
and in too many instances carry a strong implication of the want
of the thing itself.&nbsp; Religion is first pure, then
<i>peaceable</i>, &ldquo;<i>gentle</i>, <i>easy to be
entreated</i>, full of <i>mercy</i> and of good
fruits.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is modest, unassuming, kind,
benevolent.&nbsp; The &ldquo;law of kindness is in its
lips;&rdquo; and, without being servile, fawning, adulatory, or
timid, can tincture the manners of a Christian with delicacy, and
give to one, who is firm as a rock in his attachment to truth,
all imaginable softness and delicacy of address.&nbsp; It dreads
clamor, and is equally remote from forwardness and
impetuosity.&nbsp; It &ldquo;bridles the tongue,&rdquo; and forms
that &ldquo;unruly member&rdquo; for uttering the dialect of
candor, gentleness, and caution.&nbsp; It imparts the wisdom of
the serpent without the poison of its subtilty, and the
harmlessness of the dove without its timidity.&nbsp; It is
discerning, and can explore characters without impertinent
curiosity, without any pretensions to prophetic intuition, or any
interference with the private concerns of others.&nbsp; It
teaches to cultivate friendship from disinterested motives, and
to guard it by acts of delicacy and reciprocal generosity; and
will enable a Christian to make sacrifices here, when the
connexion is manifestly dangerous, whatever may be the
consequences arising from the misrepresentations <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>or slanderous
tales of the rejected party.&nbsp; In short, the loveliness of
religion and religion itself appear so interwoven with each
other, that we cannot in some points of view <i>separate</i> them
without destroying the very essence of Christianity.&nbsp; Of
this, our Lord&rsquo;s sermon upon the mount, and St.
Paul&rsquo;s beautiful delineation of charity, that is
<i>love</i>, in 1 Cor. xiii. afford a striking proof.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Love suffereth long and is kind; charity envieth not,
vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself
unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh
no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth;
beareth (&sigmaf;&epsilon;&gamma;&epsilon;&iota; covereth) all
things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; The close examination of one of these
passages made a great man once exclaim, &ldquo;Either this is not
true, or we are not Christians.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, perhaps, were
some but to alter the form of the exclamation, by making the
first member of the sentence an affirmative, and leaving the last
in its negative state, and then apply the whole to themselves,
they would utter an awful truth, declarative of the real
condition of their character before God.</p>
<p>A distinguished writer observes, that St. Paul, in the above
description of charity, had certain characters in view, whom he
wished to wound through the medium of an abstract delineation, <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>rather than
expose them by personal or local references.&nbsp; In doing this,
he acted like a surgeon, who once enclosed a lancet in a sponge,
which he applied to a breast that wanted opening, under a
pretence of washing it, and by that delicate method at once
prevented the fears of his patient and performed the operation
that restored her health.&nbsp; But it should seem that the
apostle had to do with persons more impressible by the strokes of
his cutting pen, than those whom, in the present day, an easy and
callous profession hath rendered impenetrable by the lancet of
truth, however smooth its edge, however soft the medium through
which it passes, and however delicate the operation
throughout.&nbsp; Men, long accustomed to the favorite element of
teaching, dictating, and reproving others, seem to claim an
exclusive right of using the lancet themselves.&nbsp; And, if
they have learned to call rudeness and rusticity of manners, or
ill-timed reprehension, by the sacred name of
<i>faithfulness</i>, that word so much abused in the mouths of
the forward and impetuous, the disease becomes almost
incurable.&nbsp; It is in vain that the lancet directed against
themselves be oiled or enveloped in sponge by the most cautious
hand.&nbsp; A hint will awaken their resentment, and the most
delicate wound given to the vulnerable part will only send them
into company to give vent <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>to their malignant feelings, by
copious effusions of slander and invective, or make them ascend a
pulpit to scold and storm there.&nbsp; Yet the former is called
honesty or faithfulness, and the latter, to the scandal of the
most sacred and lovely exercise, is termed
<i>preaching</i>.&nbsp; If any thing be more surprising than
this, it is, that the one should meet with defenders, and the
other with private patrons.&nbsp; But what is it, which the
ignorance, the false zeal, and the wickedness of some will not
prompt them to defend?&nbsp; With such, the grand plea is, that
the <i>truth</i> is spoken.&nbsp; But it is this very fact that
is the grand aggravation.&nbsp; Let religion be only left out of
the question, and our complaints cease.&nbsp; But to borrow its
sacred name as a vehicle of conveyance for gall and wormwood, and
then to quote it in justification of the most unhallowed tempers,
is a double inconsistency, equally fraught with false reasoning
and sin.&nbsp; This is to furnish an answer to a question
proposed by St. James, to which he thought none but a negative
one could be given.&nbsp; &ldquo;Doth a fountain send forth at
the same place <i>sweet</i> water and <i>bitter</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; may some say, &ldquo;we will undertake to
exemplify this phenomenon, by making our tongues the vehicle of
malignity and grace.&rdquo;&nbsp; We would hope, however, for the
honor of religion, and the credit of the apostle&rsquo;s
metaphor, <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>that the <i>malignity only</i>, in many instances, comes
from the &ldquo;fountain&rdquo; within, and the sound of
<i>grace</i> is confined to the <i>tongue</i>, as its place of
residence.&nbsp; What, then, are the most splendid talents, the
finest chain of reasoning, or the greatest extent of oratorical
powers, if unaccompanied, as they certainly may be, with the
temper of Christianity?&nbsp; And in what light are we to look
upon that false fire, which has none of these glittering
recommendations, but makes its bold advance in the rude garb of
confidence, illiteracy, and moroseness?&nbsp; The former is
bearable, as a display of genius; but the latter, having neither
genius nor religion, is insupportably detestable: and the best
antidote against the dangerous influence of both, is a close
consideration of the words of St. Paul, &ldquo;Put on therefore
(<span class="smcap">as the elect of God</span>, holy and
beloved) <i>bowels of mercies</i>, <i>kindness</i>,
<i>humbleness</i> of mind, <i>meekness</i>,
<i>long-suffering</i>; Col. iii. 12: let all <i>bitterness</i>
and <i>wrath</i>, and <i>anger</i>, and <i>clamor</i>, and
<i>evil-speaking</i>, be put away from you, with all
<i>malice</i>; and be ye <i>kind</i> one to another,
<i>tender-hearted</i>, <i>forgiving</i> one another, even as God,
for Christ&rsquo;s sake, hath forgiven you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ephes.
iv. 31, 32.</p>
<p>Some little acquaintance with the religious world, added, I
hope, to some little knowledge of religion itself, has helped to
furnish these <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>remarks.&nbsp; Subjects are seen to most advantage, when
placed in a contrasted point of view.&nbsp; And as there cannot
exist a greater contrast than the essence of religion, when
opposed to the spurious profession of it, or the loveliness of
its character to the deformity in which it is sometimes
exhibited; a regard to truth, and a sincere desire to recommend
it in its native beauty to those who may have mistaken its
nature, or to such as may have been prejudiced through the
unlovely behaviour of its injudicious patrons, have extorted from
me a discrimination of characters, which, if more amply
discussed, would be proportionably useful.&nbsp; Let none then
impute to religion, what is only imputable to fallen man, who
abuses it; nor any form his ideas of it from the unsightly attire
in which enthusiasm or false zeal <i>chooses</i> to array
it.&nbsp; To view its genuine excellence, search the
scriptures.&nbsp; To form a collective idea of its principal
<i>features</i>, take into your account the faith of Abraham, the
meekness of Moses, the patience of Job, the wisdom of Solomon,
with the deep repentance and sacred zeal of his father; that most
noble act of forgiveness shewn by Joseph to his brethren, and by
Stephen to his murderers, with the triumph of this lovely temper
in the conduct of Jacob towards the enraged Esau; the holy
intrepidity of prophets, the persevering boldness of apostles, <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>together with
the noble sacrifices which they made, who &ldquo;took joyfully
the spoiling of their goods, and who loved not their lives even
unto death,&rdquo; for the sake of the gospel; the invincible
zeal of St. Paul, the boldness of Peter, the affectionate and
amiable temper of &ldquo;the beloved disciple.&rdquo;&nbsp; But,
as some infirmity was blended with the virtues of the most
illustrious of these characters, behold all their respective and
detached excellencies, concentring in their most bright
assemblage, without frailty or sin, in the sacred person and
spotless life of the blessed Jesus.&nbsp; In him, the scattered
rays of human and angelic excellence all meet, and from him they
derive their irradiation.&nbsp; And it is in Jesus alone that you
see all the essence, and all the loveliness of religion
exemplified; because of him alone it is true &ldquo;that he was
holy, harmless, undefiled, and separate from
sinners.&rdquo;&nbsp; Form your ideas, in both respects, from
him; and from that excellence in every character, that most
resembles him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let that mind be in you, which was
also in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Phil. ii.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be ye
followers of me, says Paul, even as I also am of
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then say, whether religion does not
surpass in beauty and excellence, every thing below; that assumes
the name of the one or the other.&nbsp; What is it that guides
reason, sanctifies philosophy, adorns literature?&nbsp; What, <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>but
religion?&nbsp; Without which, the sublimest style of mental
exertion may be not only useless in the end, but even
pernicious.&nbsp; What is the loveliest form, or the lustre of
the fairest countenance, unaccompanied with those tempers and
that demeanor, which religion teaches?&nbsp; What is the crowning
accomplishment in all those graces, that charm the beholder, and
make the possessor of them happy?&nbsp; Religion.&nbsp; Of how
much greater worth is the aspect of benevolence, the look of
modesty, the calm reply, the gentle and unassuming carriage, than
all the blooming tincture of a skin!&nbsp; In vain do the rose
and lily diversify their lovely tints to beautify that
countenance, which covers a heart full of pride and vanity.&nbsp;
Even when disease or age makes ravages on external charms,
religion possesses the exclusive power of rendering itself
amiable under all these disadvantages, and of communicating
loveliness amidst all the ruins of declining nature.&nbsp; But,
without religion, how awful the idea of a form, once the object
of adoration, consumed by disease and turned into putrefaction by
death! once the fair enclosure of a mind, the seat of sin, and
now separated, for a season, from those tempers, which being let
loose upon the soul, fill it, in its disembodied state, with
misery and terror; and, when returning, as they will do in the
morning of the resurrection, will complete the <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>unhappiness
and disgrace of soul and body for ever!&nbsp; Solemn
reflection!&nbsp; Sufficient, one would think, to inspire parents
with the ambition of instilling religion, as the grand endowment,
into the minds of their children; and to make their offspring
anxious to seek the one thing needful.&nbsp; In short, the most
elaborate mode of education, in which this is omitted, is but a
refined mode of training up the rising generation to the most
certain destruction.&nbsp; It is religion that gives the
loveliest charms to youth, and makes the hoary head a crown of
glory.&nbsp; Even the monarch upon his throne is not half so
august by the crown that adorns his brow, as he is, by the
religion which makes him the father of his people, and the
obedient subject of the King of kings.</p>
<p><i>The prospects</i> of religion.&nbsp; Were the religion of
Jesus Christ to be limited in the duration of its influence to
this life alone, it would well demand the care and anxiety of
mankind to understand its nature.&nbsp; But &ldquo;godliness hath
not only the promise of this life,&rdquo; of a secure passage
through all its snares, and of a proportion of grace to surmount
every difficulty, and come off victorious, but it hath also a
promise of that life &ldquo;which is to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
title to it is secured by the everlasting righteousness of
Christ, the gift of the Father, the covenant <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>faithfulness
of the three persons in the Godhead, and the representation of
all God&rsquo;s elect in the highest heavens, in the person of
their illustrious Head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; says he in
John, xvii. &ldquo;that they whom thou hast given me be <i>with
me where I am</i>, that they may behold my glory.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whom he justified, them he <i>also</i> <span
class="GutSmall">GLORIFIED</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. viii.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is the Father&rsquo;s good pleasure to give you the
kingdom.&nbsp; He that believeth hath eternal life,&rdquo; in the
earnest and commencement of it, and shall infallibly have it in
its consummation.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will give grace and he will
give glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. lxxxiv.&nbsp; The first-fruits
here ensure the inheritance hereafter.&nbsp; What Jehovah hath
transferred in the bond of the covenant, he will never annul or
revoke; because &ldquo;two immutable things,&rdquo; the promise
and oath, &ldquo;in which it was impossible for God to
lie,&rdquo; shew to the heirs of promise the immutability of his
counsel, and make their admission to glory a certainty in
prospect, and, at last, in possession.&nbsp; Thus speaks in the
language of sovereign authority the divine person who undertook
to purchase, and claims the honour of conferring, eternal life
upon his people, &ldquo;I <span class="GutSmall">GIVE UNTO THEM
ETERNAL LIFE, AND THEY SHALL NEVER PERISH</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such is the glorious prospect, which religion, as a system of
infallible truth and divine certainty, sets before the believer
in Christ.&nbsp; Several <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>considerations unite their force to
prove this prospect of future blessedness, to be in every respect
worthy of Him, who gives it, and fully calculated to ascertain
the hopes of those who entertain it.&nbsp; The basis of the
expectation is the well ordered covenant, or that irreversible
stipulation in the contracting parties, by which the Father hath
agreed &ldquo;to give eternal life to as many as he hath
given&rdquo; to the Son.&nbsp; John, xvii.&nbsp; This title-deed
is sealed with the blood of the Surety of the New Testament, who
became responsible for fulfilling all its conditions.&nbsp; The
testament supposes the death of the testator; without which, it
has no force.&nbsp; And the testament, solemnly executed by that
event, implies a bequest of blessings, the transfer of which must
take place in perfect conformity to the will of the testator;
which will is a perfect transcript of the covenant of redemption
agreed upon &ldquo;in the counsel of peace which was between
both&rdquo; the Father and the Son before all worlds.&nbsp; The
work finished upon the cross by the Mediator, was the
accomplishment of that &ldquo;obedience unto death,&rdquo; which
he had stipulated to render to law and justice, in doing and
suffering the will of the Father.&nbsp; Psal. xl.&nbsp; Heb.
x.&nbsp; The believer, who receives God&rsquo;s testimony
respecting this transaction, &ldquo;lays hold of the
covenant&rdquo; to save him from death; apprehends <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>the
Mediator&rsquo;s righteousness as his title to glory, and sees
the inheritance now secure by a reversion of the forfeiture
incurred through the disobedience of Adam.&nbsp; Here is firm
footing.&nbsp; On this rock the believer founds his salvation and
builds his prospects, which ought never to be obscured by doubts
and uncertainty, since the expectations, which the gospel teaches
him to entertain, spring from a hope that is &ldquo;sure and
stedfast, and which entereth into that within the
vail.&rdquo;&nbsp; Heb. vi. 19.</p>
<p>How different is the prospect, afforded through the medium of
promises, from that vouchsafed to Moses of the land of
Canaan!&nbsp; He was commanded to ascend the top of mount Pisgah,
was from thence shewn the goodly inheritance, but, to call to his
remembrance and to punish his sin, at the waters of Meribah, was
told he must die on that mount, and never personally enter that
land which his eye then so wishfully surveyed.&nbsp; Faith gives
the prospective view of the celestial Canaan; hope anticipates an
admission into it; and nothing can possibly occur to darken the
animating prospect, to frustrate the joyful anticipation, or to
hinder actual possession.&nbsp; Sin, that would bar the entry, is
taken away by the sacrifice of the Son of God.&nbsp; The great
&ldquo;forerunner is <i>for us</i> entered,&rdquo; and hath taken
possession of the glorious inheritance in behalf of <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>his
people.&nbsp; Not one angry cloud can intercept the prospect,
since the Sun of Righteousness hath arisen with healing in his
wings, to dissipate those noxious mists of darkness, which would
otherwise have enveloped in impenetrable gloom our views of
future happiness.&nbsp; &ldquo;He hath blotted out as a thick
cloud our transgressions, and as a cloud our sins.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The purchase is made in full proportion to the extent and glory
of the inheritance, though in both respects infinite.&nbsp; The
promise of admission is given by Him, whose veracity is pledged,
and whose omnipotence is exerted, to accomplish what he hath
spoken.&nbsp; The believer has, therefore, nothing to do but die,
and take possession of a portion, of which earth and hell, sin
and Satan, law and justice, life and death, cannot deprive
him.</p>
<p>Delightful prospect! glorious inheritance!&nbsp; What are the
dim uncertain prospects which this world affords, when compared
with the luminous and well grounded prospect of future
glory!&nbsp; Or what is the duration of them, even if they were
realized to the full extent of human wishes, compared with that
glorious eternity, which is to stamp perpetuity and purity on the
Christian&rsquo;s bliss through everlasting ages!&nbsp; Here some
earthly hope seizes the imagination, and paints there in
captivating colours some fair future prospect, that looks bright,
and promises bliss.&nbsp; <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>A slight contingence, such as this
world abounds with, soon occurs, makes the imaginary Eden vanish,
and leaves the soul smarting under the anguish of delusive and
disappointed expectation.&nbsp; Happy if those, who have existed
in this ideal earthly heaven, see their error, and lay hold on a
hope, the powers of which, in their greatest expansion, can never
form the idea of that immortality with which it blooms!&nbsp; How
often does vain man rest his hope on an arm of flesh, and erect
his prospects on human promises, uncertain as the wind, and
unsolid as the floating bubble!&nbsp; Religion teaches us to
desert these weak resources, and to rely on the promises of the
gospel, which, he who revealed them, wants neither sincerity nor
ability to fulfil.&nbsp; While multitudes circumscribe their
views, and contract their happiness within the narrow limits of a
miserable and short-lived existence, imbittered by cares and
bounded by time; the believer passes these boundaries, with a
noble ambition, enlivens his prospects, and expands his views
with the anticipation of future glory.&nbsp; Thus,
&ldquo;mounting on wings as eagles,&rdquo; he ascends the sacred
hill of contemplation; from thence views by the eye of faith the
fair inheritance, which is prepared for him; and often breaks out
into effusions of joy and gratitude, under the impressions of
such a ravishing prospect.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>rich
inheritance does my wondering eye survey!&nbsp; How extensive!
how glorious!&nbsp; What is a land flowing with milk and honey,
the glory of Israel&rsquo;s portion, compared with a country,
where there are rivers of pleasures, and joys for evermore!&nbsp;
Here no sorrow can imbitter, no sin diminish, no enemies
interrupt, no lapse of time exhaust, the joys of its blest
inhabitants.&nbsp; Here is an eternal sabbath, an uninterrupted
state of repose.&nbsp; No fruits of the curse, no assaults of
Satan, can endanger the bliss of this Eden, through which flows
the river of life, clear as crystal, from the throne of God and
of the Lamb, and in which grows the tree of life, whose fruit is
the repast of heaven, and whose leaves are for the healing of the
nations.&nbsp; Here is that society, which the most perfect
harmony unites, which the blood of Christ redeemed, and which his
grace shall animate with songs of never-ending praise.&nbsp; Here
is the mansion of rest and glory, which the Redeemer went before
to prepare for his once disconsolate disciples.&nbsp; But is this
mansion mine?&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; He who purchased it is mine, and I
am his; and the mansion where he dwells is mine, by covenant
right, by gratuitous donation, by unalterable promise, by rich
redemption.&nbsp; Unworthy of admission, his righteousness alone
is my title and recommendation.&nbsp; Ah! what are now the little
busy scenes <a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>of earth, that perplex the mind and engross so much time
and thought? or what the gilded trifles of the world, riches,
honors, and pleasures?&nbsp; They all die away and disappear,
absorbed in this delightful prospect, as stars that vanish before
the mid-day sun.&nbsp; The world recedes, heaven opens to my
view, death is advancing to fix the period, where my happiness
begins, that shall never conclude.&nbsp; Soon shall I see Him, in
whom all my hopes and happiness are wrapt up, and cast my crown
in deep humility before his throne.&nbsp; Let the world change,
time flow with its wonted velocity, the outward man decay, and
death put on his most terrific form: still this can make no
alteration in my state, or impede my prospects into glory.&nbsp;
I rejoice in hope of it, and shall one day enter upon the
possession of what &lsquo;eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, and
which it hath not entered into the heart of man to
conceive.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether we consider religion in its origin, foundation,
nature, influence, fruits, and evidences; or examine the
consolations it imparts, the attractive loveliness it displays,
and the prospects it opens to its happy votaries; it must, in
every point of view, be a concern of great importance.</p>
<p>The <i>importance</i> of religion.&nbsp; This an inspired
writer comprehends in the following short sentence, <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>&ldquo;Godliness is profitable for all
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; Man&rsquo;s best interests here and
hereafter, are essentially interwoven with the experience and
practice of it.&nbsp; As a dependent, dying, sinful creature, he
can never act his part honorably through life, or meet death
without dismay or stupefaction, but as supported by the guidance
and consolations of true religion.&nbsp; In every line of life it
is of infinite utility.&nbsp; By making sin hateful, it guards
against the false maxims or vicious examples, that would hide the
deformity, or give sanction to the practice of that great
abomination.&nbsp; If we ask, Why do fraud, injustice,
oppression, predominate, to the overturning of all the rights of
humanity, the laws of conscience, and the claims of civil
liberty?&nbsp; The answer is at hand.&nbsp; Because the sacred
mandates of religion, which transfer these privileges as the
unalienable claim of human nature, have been disregarded.&nbsp;
Had the voice of religion been only heard, and her merciful
dictates obeyed, an inhuman traffic would not, for so long a
season, have transmitted its bitter fruits to this country, at
the expense of the blood, the sweat and toil, the lives and
liberties of millions of our fellow-creatures.&nbsp; Barbarous
traffic! that begins, and is prompted by avarice, is conducted by
desolation, oppression, and unprovoked hostilities, and that ends
in a species of slavery, which, in <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>point of enormity, has hardly ever
had an example among the most uncivilized heathens!&nbsp; But who
knows but the happy hour of emancipation is at hand?&nbsp; The
cries of the poor Africans, that have long entered the ears of
the Lord of Sabbath, are likely soon to be carried to the ears of
our legislators, through the laudable exertions of some, who
deserve all praise for having taken the lead in this humane
undertaking.&nbsp; Others are taking up the subject with equal
ardor.&nbsp; Let us figure to ourselves, thousands of our
fellow-creatures, torn from the embraces of friends and
relations, and dragged from their native home; sold by an African
tyrant, to a greater one from England; linked together like oxen
under a yoke; driven in that ignominious situation to a floating
prison that is to receive them; treated without the smallest
regard to the delicacy of sex or age; and at last, after a voyage
that proves fatal to many, transported to a foreign clime, there
to undergo the severest toil, and smart under the lash of a
merciless planter; and there, by an accumulation of slavery and
misery, often sold by public advertisement like beasts of the
field, and transmitted from one mercenary hand to another; till
exhausted by excessive toil, or cut off by the tortures of an
inventive barbarity, death comes at last, self-procured in many
instances, to close the dismal <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>tragedy.&nbsp; I say, let us form to
ourselves an idea of this concatenated slavery and misery, in the
case of millions of our own species, who have the reason and
feelings of men, and then we shall unite our prayers and
supplications with the rest of the nation, for the purpose of
procuring the abolition of such an execrable traffic.&nbsp; It is
a solecism in politics, that in a free constitution, like that of
Great Britain, there should exist <i>one</i> slave in the whole
extent of the British empire.&nbsp; How great the solecism, then,
that it should connive at the commerce that enslaves
thousands!&nbsp; Should our legislators take the matter into
serious consideration, the act that would emancipate the subjects
of West Indian vassalage, would reflect the highest honor on the
wisdom and humanity of British legislation, and make the British
name more dear and more illustrious, than all the conquests that
have carried it with so much renown to every distant corner of
the globe.&nbsp; The event would form a memorable epocha in the
annals of British history; would exemplify the genius of that
pure and undefiled religion, the leading characteristic of which
is, that it is &ldquo;<i>full of mercy</i>;&rdquo; and would be
an imitation of its great Author, who &ldquo;came not to destroy
men&rsquo;s lives but to save them;&rdquo; not to rob them of the
sweets of liberty, but in the most exalted sense to make them
free.&nbsp; <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>The voice of religion, the voice of justice, the voice
of humanity, the voice of the nation, and I am sure I may add,
the voice of God, says, &ldquo;Abolish slavery, and extend the
blessings of freedom to the oppressed Africans.&rdquo;&nbsp; What
a high indulgence would it be to the feelings of humanity, to be
the bearer of the act that would confirm the blessing, and spread
the joyful intelligence through the seats of oppression and
slavery abroad! <a name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a></p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>But it
is not to the West Indies or to Africa alone, that we are to wish
the blessings of liberty.&nbsp; Even in this land of freedom we
abound with slaves; who, while entreating liberty for others,
feel not the chains that enslave themselves to a degree the most
humiliating.&nbsp; Many boast of political freedom, who are under
the galling yoke of spiritual thraldom.&nbsp; They are tied and
bound with the chains of sin, which is the worst slavery, and are
led captive by Satan, the most dreadful of tyrants.&nbsp; Yet
they bear his yoke contentedly, and feel not the chains that form
a sad prelude of eternal captivity.&nbsp; But here the great
importance of religion is displayed.&nbsp; By revealing an act of
emancipation from the council of the Trinity, and directing a
world of captives to look for life and liberty to Jesus the
mighty Redeemer, it &ldquo;opens the prison to them that are
bound,&rdquo; Isa. lxi. 1, and shows a ransom paid down by his
precious death, which makes infinite justice say in behalf of the
sinner who believes the record, &ldquo;Deliver him from going
down to the pit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Oh! that each enslaved sinner may
apply the great redemption! and, &ldquo;knowing the truth as it
is in Jesus,&rdquo; be set free from the entanglements of the
world, the dominion of his lusts, or the more refined but deeply
rooted delusion of self-righteousness!</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>See the
importance of religion, when other things, even the most
estimable, are brought in competition with it.&nbsp; Form
life&rsquo;s estimate agreeably to the pursuits and plans of its
greatest admirers, and throw into the scale whatever weighs
heaviest in the opinion of the sons of opulence and of
dissipation.&nbsp; Load the balance with riches, honors, pomp,
and pleasures, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and
the pride of life.&nbsp; This is the whole aggregate of
terrestrial good.&nbsp; But what can all this avail, to shield
the sinner from the terrors of the law, the clamors of
conscience, or the wrath of Heaven? to give him tranquillity of
mind under the pain of inward reproaches, or afford him
confidence in the hour of dissolution.&nbsp; &ldquo;Riches profit
not in the day of wrath; but righteousness delivereth from
death.&rdquo;&nbsp; Prov. xi. 4.&nbsp; For how short a season are
riches possessed!&nbsp; How many thorny cares, and ensnaring
temptations, are connected with that possession to imbitter and
make it dangerous.&nbsp; That inward peace which religion
inspires, is so far from being the companion of opulence, that
the wealthy and the great are in general strangers to its
heaven-born influence.&nbsp; The happiness that flows from it,
quits the mansions of vicious pomp and earthly magnificence, and
takes up its abode in the dwellings of poverty <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>and
dependence, where grace teaches contentment, and opens through
Christ the prospect of final deliverance from every trouble, in
its root and effects.&nbsp; Examine more closely these opposite
conditions, with the characters respectively which they
include.&nbsp; Fancy a sinner, full of wealth and bold in
sin.&nbsp; He lives &ldquo;as without God in the world,&rdquo;
indulges his pride, and feeds his lusts with the provision, which
might be used to the noblest purposes.&nbsp; Accustomed to the
tribute of flattery and homage from unfortunate and fawning
dependants, his heart drinks in the luscious poison, which feeds
his self-consequence, but at the same time renders him more
sensible of mortification from the affronts of superiors, and
impatient under the afflictive hand of Providence.&nbsp; His
heart swells and says, &ldquo;Who is the Lord that I should obey
him?&rdquo; and his life more emphatically speaks the insolent
question.&nbsp; In his family, in his closet, in his
conversation, in his thoughts, God has no place, religion is not
allowed to enter; except when infidelity fills the
scorner&rsquo;s chair, profaneness animates &ldquo;the song of
the drunkard,&rdquo; or Satan suggests the bold imprecation, the
vulgar oath, or immodest jest.&nbsp; That is, religion is never
introduced but to be <i>ridiculed</i>, nor suffered admission for
a moment, but to be driven out again with disgrace by the scourge
of the infidel&rsquo;s <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>tongue.&nbsp; Thus he lives
independent of the Being, who gave him life, and rebellious
against the mercy that spares it.&nbsp; But mercy will not always
spare, nor life always last.&nbsp; See him on his
death-bed.&nbsp; The farce of life is ending; the curtain about
to be drawn on all its pleasurable scenes; and the dismal tragedy
begins.&nbsp; If not hardened with infidelity or stupified by
disease, all within feels dark, uncertain, and disturbed, full of
fears and forebodings, the prelude of hell.&nbsp; What will his
riches avail him now?&nbsp; They can procure him medicines,
physicians, attendants.&nbsp; But the king of terrors mocks all
their assistance.&nbsp; The sinner wants now, what they cannot
give: he wants <i>religion</i>.&nbsp; But the joys of that, with
all the peace and hope it inspires, are fled for ever.&nbsp;
Behold the contrast.&nbsp; Look into the humble habitation of a
little family, sequestered from the noise and snares of life,
like the humble shrub in a valley, that escapes the fury of the
tempest, which tears up by the roots the lofty cedar.&nbsp; See
at the head of this modest happy household, an upright Christian,
whose industry provides them food, and whose religious example
leads them in the way to heaven.&nbsp; His daily resolution
resembles that of Joshua, &ldquo;As for me and my house, we will
serve the Lord;&rdquo; and his practice exemplifies it.&nbsp; The
morning finds him upon his knees to implore the blessing <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>of Heaven:
the day is closed with thanksgivings to God for the gift of his
Son, and for every domestic, social, and personal blessing
vouchsafed, of which his evening sacrifice is a solemn and
grateful recognition.&nbsp; The sacred scriptures are constantly
applied to, as to a source of uncorrupted truth, of consolation,
guidance, and instruction.&nbsp; The religion which they inspire,
sweetens his cares, is a spur to industry, and helps him to bear
the frowns of the world, or the visitations of domestic
affliction, with patience and submission; persuaded that the
goodness and faithfulness of his heavenly Father will &ldquo;make
all work together for good.&rdquo;&nbsp; To walk by faith with
God reconciled to him through the Son of his love; to act as
under the inspection of his all-seeing eye in his intercourse
with men; to bring forth the fruits of faith and keep a
conscience void of the least allowed offence; <i>constitute</i>
the main business of life, and the chief object of his care and
solicitude.</p>
<p>But <a name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55"
class="citation">[55]</a> see the righteous drawing near the hour
of his dissolution; then do the graces of faith, of patience, and
of resignation, shine forth with the most resplendent
lustre.&nbsp; Confidently relying <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>upon the mercy of God through Jesus
Christ, neither the debilitating pains of protracted sickness,
nor the more excruciating agonies of acute disorders, provoke a
murmur from his lips.&nbsp; At the prospect of that hour, the
very thought of which is terrible to the unbeliever, his happy
soul exults; and knowing that death is the gate to everlasting
life, he longs for the moment of his dismission, when he shall
enter into the joy of his Lord, and join the glorified spirits of
the redeemed in songs of unceasing praise.&nbsp; How important is
Religion, if such be it&rsquo;s termination, and with how much
justice are all our afflictions called light and momentary,
seeing they work out for us an eternal and exceeding weight of
glory!&nbsp; O my soul, let me die the death of the righteous,
and let my latter end be like his!</p>

<p style="text-align: center">[Preached at Nantwich, July 28,
1782.]</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What new doctrine is this?&rdquo;&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">Mark</span>, i. 27.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you look back to the
twenty-first verse of the chapter, you find our Lord teaching in
a synagogue at Capernaum, and all his hearers filled with
astonishment at his doctrine.&nbsp; Truth naked and unadorned has
been known often to produce this effect.&nbsp; How irresistibly
powerful must have been its efficacy, in the mouth of such a
Teacher! whose manner was as engaging, as his wisdom was
profound!&nbsp; What seems principally to have struck the
audience, while listening to the incomparable doctrines of the
Lord Jesus, was, &ldquo;that he taught them as one that had
authority, and not as the scribes.&rdquo;&nbsp; For, as <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the origin of
truth is divine, it claims the just prerogative of commanding
obedience to its sanctions, and gives its advocates an authority
in pleading her injured rights, which error can seldom
counterfeit.</p>
<p>That our blessed Lord might authenticate his mission, and
enforce his doctrine, he took occasion, in the synagogue, to
dispossess a demoniac.&nbsp; The unclean spirit that tormented
him instantly yielded obedience to the word of Jesus, after
having previously acknowledged him to be &ldquo;the Holy One of
God,&rdquo; verse 24.&nbsp; A miracle, performed upon such an
occasion, and attested by a variety of circumstances of public
notoriety, excited the amazement of all present; who said,
&ldquo;What thing is this?&nbsp; What new doctrine is
this?&rdquo;&nbsp; Two things were the object of their surprise;
the miraculous cure of the demoniac, and the supposed novelty of
our Lord&rsquo;s doctrine.&nbsp; But had they been properly
conversant in the writings of their favorite lawgiver Moses, they
would have seen, that Jesus came not to reveal truths in their
nature absolutely new, and altogether unknown; but only to place
in a new light, to communicate by a new style of preaching, and
to enforce by motives unfolded with clearer radiance, those
original truths, which the divine legation and ritual economy of
Moses, as well as the corroborating testimony of all the <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>prophets,
were intended to teach from the beginning.&nbsp; See Acts, x. 43,
and John, v. 45.&nbsp; But St. Paul accounts for this ignorance
in the Jews, and the prejudices which sprung from it, by
observing, that &ldquo;their minds were blinded: for, until this
day, remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the
Old Testament; which vail is done away in Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2
Cor. iii. 14.&nbsp; Had not &ldquo;a vail&rdquo; of darkness and
unbelief &ldquo;been upon their hearts,&rdquo; they would have
both known and acknowledged, that the doctrines which Jesus
preached, were of patriarchal as well as Mosaic antiquity; and
that Jehovah himself &ldquo;preached <i>that gospel</i> unto
Abraham,&rdquo; Gal. iii. 8, which Jesus came to confirm and
elucidate by a dispensation, superior in light and glory to any
that had preceded it; and that what &ldquo;God spake at sundry
times and in divers manners unto the fathers by the prophets, he
spake in the last days by his Son.&rdquo;&nbsp; Heb. i. 1.</p>
<p>Blindness in the Jews made them fix the charge of novelty on
the doctrines of Christ, although so visibly inscribed with the
marks of divine authenticity; and the effect of that presumptive
and hasty imputation, was an unwillingness to receive his
testimony or credit the truth of his mission; and the
consequence, a stubborn opposition to truth and a fatal
insensibility <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>in sin, terminating, at last, in such judgments as
render them now a hissing and a proverb to all the nations of the
earth.</p>
<p>But, are such prejudices new? or was the baneful root of them
confined only to the regions of Jud&aelig;a?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; In
this land, and in this day, with all the advantages which we
derive from the free circulation of the word of God, and from a
national establishment so auspicious to the interests of truth,
there are multitudes, who are ready to cry out, when they hear
the gospel, as &ldquo;certain philosophers of the Epicureans and
of the Stoics&rdquo; did, when Paul preached at Athens,
&ldquo;Thou bringest certain strange things to our ears.&nbsp;
May we know what this <i>new doctrine</i>, whereof thou speakest,
is?&rdquo;&nbsp; Acts, xvii. 19, 20.&nbsp; Thus, with many, to
attribute novelty to a system, is the way to reprobate, and make
it odious.&nbsp; And there are not a few, who satisfy themselves
with no other argument for their unbelief, than that they may
have happened not to hear before, what they contemptuously
spurn.&nbsp; As if the nature of truth can be altered, or the
credit of it shaken, by the want of previous acquaintance.&nbsp;
We should have thought it a strange species of argumentation, had
the Athenian philosophers attempted to demonstrate, that St.
Paul&rsquo;s doctrine must have been false, merely <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>because it
was new, and they happened not to hear it before.&nbsp; Yet upon
this weak ground, do numbers reject the truth, and militate
against their own happiness; while their conduct is as grossly
repugnant to the dictates of calm reason and common sense, as it
is reprobated by the voice of scripture.&nbsp; It will be a poor
excuse, for any to make at the tribunal of Christ, that they
contemned the great doctrines of revelation, merely because they
thought them novel, when they neglected the opportunity of being
convinced to the contrary; or that they adopted their ideas, and
regulated their practice, by the maxims of the world.&nbsp; Such
apologies, with all the mistake and precipitancy on which they
are founded, may pass current now with those, who are credulous
enough to drink in the monstrous absurdities of infidelity,
whether ancient or modern.&nbsp; But, they will never satisfy
those, who wishing to investigate truth at the fountain-head,
like the noble Bereans, &ldquo;search the scriptures daily,
whether those things are so.&rdquo;&nbsp; Acts, xvii. 11.&nbsp;
And that none here may ignorantly plead such excuses, for their
indifference or unbelief on a subject of such vast concern, I
will endeavour, <i>First</i>, to show what the doctrine is which
we preach, and on which we build our eternal all; and,
<i>Secondly</i>, That this doctrine is no more justly chargeable
with novelty, than <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>it is with error; and, <i>Thirdly</i>, That other
objections brought against the ministers of the gospel, are
equally frivolous and undeserved.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; As to the doctrines, which we preach, although we
look upon ourselves accountable for them to that most excellent
church, whose system of theology is the glory of her
establishment, and the sacred depositum of all her ministers;
yet, when truth is concerned, we acknowledge ourselves obliged to
look from her authority, venerable as it is, to the infallible
decisions of the lively oracles of God; since every church and
every doctrine must be tried, must stand or fall, by that great
standard.&nbsp; To the sacred scriptures we are glad to appeal,
as to a divine authority, not superseding, but corroborating the
doctrines of our church; without which, no obligation, arising
merely from a national establishment, could lie upon the
conscience to believe and receive them.&nbsp; And, indeed, the
liberality and candor of our church appear in this, that she
unites with the state in granting what, it must be confessed, are
the natural rights of all who think themselves authorized to
dissent from her: and admits in her sixth <i>article</i>, that
&ldquo;whatsoever may not be proved by holy scripture, is not to
be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article
of faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; Taking it for granted, however, that her
constitution is <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>founded upon a scripture model, and her articles
consonant with the truth as it is in Jesus, while she requires,
and has indeed an indisputable right to insist, that her
ministers should preach those doctrines, and those only, which
she had professedly derived from the fountain of truth in sacred
writ; she has manifestly opened to them a fair opportunity of
investigating the origin, and examining the tendency, of the
system she hath received, and of acting agreeably to the result
of their researches.&nbsp; No dissentient, therefore, can plead
hardship or injury in this case.&nbsp; If he be out of the
church, he is not compelled to come in.&nbsp; And if he should
happen to be within the pale of her communion, no compulsion is
exercised to keep him there.&nbsp; He was supposed to enter
freely and cordially, and is permitted as freely to go out, if
his sentiments are inimical to her great distinguishing
doctrines.&nbsp; She hath only claimed, what every society in the
world hath thought itself warranted to claim for the security of
its laws and the benefit of its members; and that is, a liberty
of judging for herself.&nbsp; And that judgment she conceives to
be obligatory and directory to her ministers, not as set up in
opposition to the word of God, but as perfectly coincident with
its authority.</p>
<p>In this, view, when a minister of the Church of England is
either directly by controversy, or <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>indirectly by secretly-invidious
imputations, called upon to declare and vindicate his sentiments;
to all the members of the same church with himself, he has a
right to quote her authority as a sufficient justification of the
tenets he inculcates; and has an equal right to expect, that an
unequivocal appeal to her discriminating doctrines ought to be
considered as an indirect evidence, at least, of the uprightness
of his intentions, if not of the orthodoxy of his
sentiments.&nbsp; He thinks himself authorized to expect too,
that he should be reputed an honest man, as long as he professes
to advance nothing but in subserviency to the scheme of doctrine
which he solemnly subscribed at his ordination.&nbsp; And should
he happen to err, yet candor should acknowledge, that he is
mistaken with the Church of England, since her sentiments he
avows as his own.&nbsp; And in such venerable company he is not,
and cannot be supposed to be ashamed to declare them, that all
may judge for themselves of the inconsistency or validity of his
pretensions.&nbsp; And, when interrogated, he might think it a
sufficient apology to say, &ldquo;If you wish to know my
sentiments, from any secret supposition of their heterodoxy, I
refer you to the 39 articles of that church, of which we are both
members.&nbsp; I subscribed to those articles with hand and
heart.&nbsp; My assent and consent to them were sincere and <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>unequivocal.&nbsp; I firmly believe them to be agreeable
to the word of God; and, while they epitomize the sentiments of
the church, they speak my own.&nbsp; As such I believe them, and
I preach them.&nbsp; Read over those articles, therefore, and you
may then know, what are the leading topics of my
ministrations.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such an answer a minister of the
gospel might esteem a reasonable and a sufficient one, to
cavillers of every description, when either ignorance censures,
or malevolence detracts.&nbsp; But lest, upon the present
occasion, such an appeal should be thought to carry too much the
appearance of indolence and evasion, I will endeavour, with all
the faithfulness and precision in my power, to state the outlines
of that system of doctrine, which I verily believe to be
according to truth and godliness, and upon which I build my own
hopes and prospects for eternity.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Although the nature of God, as a Being of infinite
wisdom, power, justice, glory, purity, and goodness, surpasses
the comprehension of men and angels; yet, according to the
revelation which he hath thought proper to give of himself in
holy scripture, we think ourselves authorized to believe, and to
preach in consequence, that in the divine essence there are three
persons, who are incomprehensibly <i>one</i> in all the
perfections of the Godhead; and, according to <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>their
respective offices in the economy of redemption, are called in
scripture, <i>Father</i>, <i>Son</i>, and <i>Spirit</i>; that,
though economically and personally three, they are essentially
one; that all objections to this doctrine arising from the
incomprehensibility of it, apply equally to the truth of the very
being of a God; and that a denial of it, is one of those heresies
that enter very deeply into an apostacy from the truth and power
of godliness.&nbsp; The doctrine of the Trinity, or of three
co-equal and co-essential persons in one undivided Godhead, as an
object of adoration to men and angels, we look upon as one of the
great mysteries of revelation, and as a fundamental article in
the Christian faith.&nbsp; If the opponents of this leading tenet
think proper, as too many of them have done, to ridicule it as
inexplicable, and contrary to reason; we are sorry for their
inconsistency, and would remind them, that their sneers might
very easily be retorted on themselves, were they only required to
account for, and reconcile with reason, a thousand phenomena in
nature, the existence of which they dare not dispute, though
their occult qualities, origin, and extent of operation, are
wrapt up in mystery.&nbsp; And if nature, in some of the most
common and sensible objects, abounds with mysteries, which
philosophy cannot explore or account for; how incomprehensible <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>must the God
of nature be, when his own peculiar mode of existence is the
object of contemplation!&nbsp; We believe, therefore, that the
impenetrable mystery that envelopes the doctrine of the Trinity
from the comprehension of reason, ought to be no bar to the
reception of it; and that it ought to be believed upon the simple
authority of revelation, like other doctrines equally mysterious,
which it would be folly and blasphemy to contradict for a
moment.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; We believe that God made man at first upright, but
that he hath sought out many inventions; and that the moral image
of the Deity stamped on his heart was obliterated by his
disobedience: in consequence of which, he instantly fell into a
deplorable state of darkness, bondage, and death.&mdash;That all
mankind were radically and federally in Adam, and were to stand
or fall in him.&mdash;That his apostacy affected all his
descendants, who inherit his fallen nature, with all the guilt
and depravity inherent in it.&nbsp; And, though the disobedience
of Adam was not, and could not be the sin of his posterity in
point of personal concurrence; yet, as an act of high treason in
a nobleman is considered, by an attainder in the law, as
affecting his children, and they suffer in their titles and
inheritance for what was properly and personally the crime of
their ancestors; so an entail of the penalty annexed <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>to the act of
original transgression, which is death, proves more forcibly,
than a thousand arguments, that there must be also an entail of
guilt; and that &ldquo;in Adam <i>all</i> died,&rdquo; 1 Cor. xv.
22, because by &ldquo;his disobedience they were made
<i>sinners</i>,&rdquo;
&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&epsilon;&sigma;&tau;&alpha;&theta;&eta;&sigma;&alpha;&nu;
&#7937;&mu;&alpha;&rho;&tau;&omega;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;, Rom.
v. 19, constituted transgressors.&nbsp; And, therefore, according
to the 9th article of the Church of England, that &ldquo;man is
very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own
nature inclined to evil;&rdquo; and that although he still
possesses all the original faculties, which in their state of
primeval rectitude constituted man the image of his Maker, yet
they are now so depraved and alienated by the fall, as to require
a divine agency to regulate and renew them.&nbsp; Indeed, the
dreadful disorder which death hath introduced into the natural
world, loudly speaks the prior existence of some fatal evil in
the moral world; and evinces, that the cause must be as malignant
as the effect is universal.&nbsp; We assert, upon the authority
of scripture, that the consequences of the first transgression to
Adam and all his descendants, which &ldquo;were in his
loins,&rdquo; as the sons of Levi are said to have &ldquo;paid
tithes in Abraham,&rdquo; Heb. vii. 9, 10, appear to have been, a
loss of the divine image, a forfeiture of happiness, a death in
sin, a subjection to the death of the body, and an obnoxiousness
to death eternal <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>of both soul and body; and that all, without exception,
that are naturally engendered of the offspring of Adam,
&ldquo;are by nature children of wrath.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ephes. ii.
1, 3.&nbsp; Rom. v. 14&ndash;21.&nbsp; Rom. vi. 23.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; It is of the highest importance to the system of
Christianity, to maintain the doctrine of human guilt and
depravity, because it is such an advantageous foil to set forth
the unbounded love and glorious redemption of the Lord Jesus
Christ; which, without an acknowledgment of the apostacy of man,
must of course be reputed a solemn redundancy, if not an absolute
nonentity.&nbsp; And it always happens, that they who deny the
fall reject some of the capital doctrines of revelation, that are
concomitant with it, and are generally convicted of entertaining
low and blasphemous thoughts concerning the person and salvation
of the Son of God.&nbsp; But as we take for granted, that that
original sin, which some have dared, in derision, to call
original nonsense, is a most melancholy and humiliating matter of
fact, we assert, that the only person qualified for rescuing man
from the consequences of that depraved and helpless condition
into which he was plunged by sin, was the eternal Son of
God.&nbsp; Of him we believe, that his qualifications for the
high office of Mediator between God and man depend entirely upon
the truth of <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>his divinity; that when the scriptures call Jesus God,
they give him that divine title in the proper sense of the word;
that he is, as Mediator, subordinate and delegated, and sent; but
not, as <i>God</i>.&nbsp; We believe the inspired writers
continually mean to represent him, under that name of divinity,
as one with the Father in the essence of the Godhead, because he
claims all the other incommunicable attributes peculiar to it;
such as omniscience, omnipresence, omnipotence, eternity of
existence a <i>parte ante</i>, &amp;c.&nbsp; We cannot conceive
that Jehovah would be the infringer of his own law, in commanding
&ldquo;all the angels of God to worship&rdquo; the Son, Heb. i.
6, if the Son were not by nature God; since a subordinate Deity,
as an object of inferior adoration, is an idea expressly
repugnant to the very letter of that law, which enjoins the
worship of one God, and condemns the translation of it to any
other being: and to worship any creature, whether a seraph or a
quadruped, whether angelic or superangelic, is idolatry; that
since the great Lawgiver could never intend to violate his own
law, which is as unchangeable as his own nature, in commanding
homage to be paid to the Messiah, he meant to proclaim to all the
earth, that &ldquo;in him dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead
bodily, &pi;&alpha;&nu; &tau;&omicron;
&pi;&lambda;&eta;&rho;&omega;&mu;&alpha; &tau;&eta;&sigmaf;
&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&tau;&eta;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&sigma;&omega;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&omega;&sigmaf;&rdquo;
Col. ii. 9.</p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>We
preach Jesus, therefore, as very God; as the agent, and end of
all things; for by him and for him were all things in heaven and
earth created.&nbsp; Col. i. 16.&nbsp; We preach his blood as
deriving all its efficacy to atone for sin, and purge the
conscience, from the infinite dignity of his divine nature.&nbsp;
We believe his righteousness to be &ldquo;the righteousness of
God&rdquo; in all respects consummate, and divinely glorious; 2
Cor. v. 21; and that, abstracted from the fulness of the Godhead,
it could have no more availed towards the justification of a
sinner before God, than the righteousness of Gabriel.&nbsp; We
believe that it was the incomprehensible yet real union of the
divine nature to the human, in the person of the Lord Christ,
that enabled him to make &ldquo;a full, perfect, and sufficient
sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction for sin,&rdquo; to bruise
the serpent&rsquo;s head, to conquer death, and to tread the
wine-press of the wrath of God.&nbsp; We believe Jesus to be
God-man, and point lost sinners to him as the object of their
trust and adoration; and we are fully persuaded, that, take away
the truth of our Lord&rsquo;s proper Deity, and you discard the
rock on which the church is built, and subvert the foundation of
his people&rsquo;s hopes.&nbsp; If unbelievers start the old
trite objection of proud reason, that this doctrine too is
unworthy of acceptation, because incomprehensible, our answer <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>is in the
words of the apostle, &ldquo;Great is the <i>mystery</i> of
godliness, God was manifest in the flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Tim.
iii. 16.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; As to the decrees and dispensations of Almighty God,
which originate in &ldquo;the good pleasure of his will,&rdquo;
Ephes. i. 5, and are made subservient to his glory, I would wish
to think of them with caution and humility, and to speak of them
with the most profound reverence: And though I cannot but
acknowledge that my thoughts recoil with horror at the idea of
God&rsquo;s dooming sinners to hell by a positive decree of
reprobation, or of his taking a delight and complacency in the
misery of any of his creatures; yet I cannot withhold my hearty
assent to that authority, which declares, that believers were
&ldquo;chosen in Christ before the foundation of the
world;&rdquo; Ephes. i. 4; that they are &ldquo;elect according
to the fore-knowledge of God;&rdquo; Pet. i. 2; that they are
&ldquo;chosen to salvation,&rdquo; 1 Thes. ii. 13, as the certain
end of that choice; and, as the 17th article says, &ldquo;that
the godly consideration of our election in Christ is full of
sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to such as <i>feel</i>
in themselves the working of the spirit of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The adversaries of this doctrine, who, in the warmth of their
zeal, apprehend, that a discriminating election of sinners to
salvation, irrespective <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span>of any moving or meritorious cause in
the creature, is an impeachment of the divine justice, seem to
forget, that to form a judgment of God&rsquo;s dispensations from
<i>our</i> ideas of equity, is fallacious and dangerous; since,
&ldquo;as the heavens are above the earth, so are his thoughts
above our thoughts, and his ways above our ways.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Isa. lv. 9.&nbsp; For &ldquo;who hath known the mind of the Lord?
or, being his counsellor, hath directed him?&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom.
xi. 34.&nbsp; Since the wisdom of God hath appeared foolishness
to the world, why may not the very equity of his proceedings to
the same incompetent and partial judges be construed into
injustice?&nbsp; Yet who would argue, that the conclusion in
either case is according to truth?&nbsp; Rather, who would not
conclude, that the same false reasoning that has deluded mankind
into an error, respecting the <i>wisdom</i> of God&rsquo;s
dispensations, should also incline them to arraign the
<i>justice</i> of them too?&nbsp; A race of beings suffering for
their apostacy under the hand of God, must, of course, view the
dispensation that inflicts their punishment, in a very malignant
light, and cannot be looked upon as competent judges in a case,
wherein torment excites rebellion, and prompts them to blaspheme
the hand of the Most High, merely because it holds the vengeful
rod of chastisement.&nbsp; The angels that left their first
estate, no doubt, think it <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>hard, that they should be
&ldquo;reserved in chains under darkness unto the judgment of the
great day;&rdquo; and, while they are suffering justly, are,
probably, ready enough to curse God as an arbitrary tyrant,
because their remediless condition leaves them in that power of
his wrath for ever?&nbsp; Yet what is the opinion of such unhappy
beings, but the impotent rage of rebels against the just
dispensations of the Holy One of Israel?</p>
<p>The charge of injustice comes with a very ill grace too from
the mouth of rebels incarnate.&nbsp; They have no claim upon
Jehovah for a single favor.&nbsp; Having forfeited all by sin,
their real desert is death eternal.&nbsp; So that, had Jehovah
thought proper to have passed by the whole human race, they would
have had no more real cause to blame, as unjust, this judicial
pretention, than the angels have, who are unexceptionably and
eternally lost.&nbsp; Instead of quarrelling, therefore, with his
dispensations and his truths, which, like his own nature, are
inscrutable; it becomes us, as sinners, to fall down at his
footstool with self-abhorrence, and to adore that great mystery
of redemption that hath opened a way of salvation for any; and,
instead of indulging a proud and disputatious temper, &ldquo;to
give all diligence to make our calling and election
sure.&rdquo;&nbsp; If a contrary spirit were carried to its full
extent, there would be no end of impeaching the divine <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>justice in
the affairs of the universe.&nbsp; The same pride that actuated
the Jews to kill the Son of God, because he pleaded the divine
sovereignty in choosing Naaman and the woman of Sarepta as
objects of his favors, above all the lepers or widows in Israel,
Luke, iv. 27, would lead men to inquire with arrogance, why this
man is born to riches and honors, while another inherits poverty
and wretchedness;&mdash;why some are idiots, and others adorned
with bright and cultivated understandings;&mdash;why some inherit
disease from their birth, and drag on a miserable life for years
in torture and pining sickness, while others enjoy an
unintermitted portion of health through every period of their
lives, and go down to their graves without any pain, save that of
dying, which, with such, is often a short and easy
transition;&mdash;why it is the fate of some to be the unhappy
subjects of insanity, that torturing disease of the mind, which
secludes them from society, and makes them dreaded as the most
furious animals; while others, by the free and vigorous exertion
of their mental powers, are ornaments to society, and preside in
the management of states and empires;&mdash;why multitudes are
condemned to the galleys, or, for no other crime but that of
defenceless and impoverished condition, are sold for slaves, and,
by an inhuman traffic, become the property of Christian <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>tyrants, who
often treat them more barbarously than the beasts that perish,
while others enjoy the protection of law, and all the blessings
of civil and religious liberty;&mdash;why one country is burnt up
with heat, another is a region of inhospitable deserts, or
inaccessible mountains; a scene of barrenness and desolation; and
a third is visited with the pestilence, or shaken with continual
earthquakes; while other parts of the globe are crowned with
perpetual verdure, are blessed with plenty and fertility, and
enjoy that constitutional peace, and unanimity, to which those
nations are strangers, that are torn with faction and depopulated
by the sword;&mdash;why some countries are visited with that
first of all national blessings, the <i>light of the gospel</i>,
while others are suffered to lie for ages buried in paganism and
superstition;&mdash;why, in particular, the Jews should have been
God&rsquo;s favorite people for more than half the period of the
world&rsquo;s present existence, and the Gentiles excluded from
their privileges, till the set time for their incorporation
arrived;&mdash;and why the gospel meets with a more favorable
reception in some places than in others, where there is no reason
to suppose that the difference arises from any superior
disposition in the hearts of the inhabitants, all being alike
dead in sin.&nbsp; These are phenomena in the dispensations of
providence, <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>which, according to the principles of some, ought to be
made a subject of curious and querulous investigation, as well as
the mysterious dealings of divine grace.&nbsp; But, if God hath a
right to do what he will with his own, in dispensing temporal
favors, why should he not be equally a sovereign in bestowing
spiritual ones? since, among all the children of men, there does
not exist a single claimant deserving for his own sake either the
one or the other, in the smallest degree of vouchsafement?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed
unto him again?&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. xi. 35.&nbsp; And, if any,
viewing the goodness and severity of God with a curious eye,
should still persist in reiterating objections, and ask,
&ldquo;Why doth he yet find fault? for, who hath resisted his
will?&rdquo;&nbsp; Our answer is in the words of St. Paul,
&ldquo;Nay, but, O man! who art thou that repliest against
God?&nbsp; Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why
hast thou made me thus?&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. ix. 20.</p>
<p>While we assert the eternal sovereignty of God in choosing
sinners to salvation, we would not insinuate that any compulsion
is exercised over the will.&nbsp; The freedom of that is
eminently preserved by the grace that restores it to the original
object of its choice.&nbsp; The will is not compelled, but drawn,
<i>suavi omnipotenti&acirc; et omnipotenti suavitate</i>, by a
sweet and all-powerful at <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>traction; and then the sinner is
&ldquo;made willing in the day of God&rsquo;s power.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Psal. cx.&nbsp; Neither has this great truth the least tendency
to relax the obligation of personal holiness, or to affect the
interests of morality in the world; since the people of God are
said to be &ldquo;chosen in Christ, <i>that they should be</i>
holy and without blame before him in love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ephes. i.
4.&nbsp; The invidious charge, that, &ldquo;if persons are chosen
to salvation they may live as they list,&rdquo; has no foundation
in truth and facts; and there is no position more abominable in
our view, than that by which some accommodate to us, &ldquo;Let
us do evil, that good may come.&rdquo;&nbsp; And to sin,
<i>because</i> grace abounds, we esteem a species of the most
detestable and first-rate wickedness.&nbsp; If some have abused
these doctrines to purposes of licentiousness; it should be
remembered, that the world in general use the opposite ones as an
opiate to lull them asleep in fatal supineness.&nbsp; So that, if
any argument be founded on the number of those who are influenced
by these tenets respectively, an immense majority will be on the
side of opposition both to truth and godliness; and the argument
must, of course, preponderate in favor of those, who, by partial
judges, are supposed to be most affected by it.&nbsp; But as we
admit of no election, but such as hath holiness for one of its
salutary streams, and <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>look for no perseverance, but such as
implies the habitual practice of good works, and a continuance in
them even to the end; so we insist, that, without the election of
grace, the power to perform them would be wanting, and the hopes
of salvation rest on a very precarious foundation.&nbsp; It is
the everlasting spring, from whence floweth that river of God,
which is full of water, that gladdens the church with its
perennial source and inexhaustible supplies.&nbsp; Built upon
this rock, the people of God are secure; and their salvation as
great a certainty, as the purposes, dispensations, covenant,
promises, and blood of Jesus, can make it.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; On the doctrine of justification, the scriptures
teach us, that the only meritorious cause or primary ground of it
before God, is the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ, which
includes his obedience to the moral law, and the satisfaction he
made to divine justice by his expiatory sufferings:&mdash;that
this righteousness is transferred to the believer by a gratuitous
imputation, and being apprehended by faith, constitutes the
ground of his peace, as well as the matter of his justification
before God:&mdash;that it is given &ldquo;unto all,&rdquo; as a
free and unmerited donation, and is &ldquo;upon all them that
believe,&rdquo; Rom. iii. 22, as a rich and immaculate garment of
salvation:&mdash;that the moment a sinner believes <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>in Jesus with
ever so weak a faith, his justification before God is complete,
because he lays hold on the perfect righteousness of
Christ.&nbsp; And by him <i>all</i> that believe are justified
from <i>all</i> things.&nbsp; Acts, xiii. 39.&nbsp; &ldquo;There
is <i>no</i> condemnation to them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. viii.
1.&mdash;And that the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ
being, in all respects, consummate and glorious, cannot want, and
will not admit of, any works of the sinner as auxiliary to his
justification.&nbsp; For, &ldquo;by the obedience of <i>One</i>
many are made righteous.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. v. 19.&nbsp; And
&ldquo;to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that
justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted to him for
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. iv. 5.</p>
<p>The faith that apprehends the righteousness of Christ, is the
gift of God; and, before it exists, no works deserve the name of
good, because, until a man&rsquo;s person is accepted, his works
cannot be well-pleasing in the sight of God; and till the tree is
made good, the fruit cannot be good.&nbsp; No good works can
precede justification by faith; and therefore the 13th article
properly observes, that &ldquo;works done before the grace of
Christ, and the inspiration of his Spirit, are not pleasant to
God, for as much as they spring not of faith in Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which truth St. Paul confirms, by declaring,
that &ldquo;without faith it is impossible to please <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Heb. xi. 6.&nbsp; Good works,
therefore, are subsequent to justification, and are not the
matter, but the evidences of it.&nbsp; They justify a believer
before men, but his faith justifies him before God; because, the
fruits of righteousness, though deserving commendation from man,
are open with all their imperfection before the eye of
omniscience; and &ldquo;in his sight can no man living be
justified.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. cxliii. 2.&nbsp; And in order that
this part of the subject may be summed up in as perspicuous and
concise a manner as possible, I close it with laying before you
the following distinction; viz. <i>A believer is justified
meritoriously by the righteousness of Christ</i>,
<i>instrumentally by faith</i>, <i>and declaratively by
works</i>.&nbsp; In the first sense, he is justified before God;
in the second, in his own conscience; and in the third, before
the world.&nbsp; These several truths are equally inimical, by
this distinction, to the pride of self righteousness, and the
licentious pleas of Antinomianism.&nbsp; And, by this
arrangement, the truth is so guarded on all sides, that Christ,
and faith, and works, have their respective place, without any
injury or dishonor to one or the other.&nbsp; For, though Christ
hath, and will have in all things the pre-eminence, and both
faith and works act in subordination, and lay all their honors at
the Redeemer&rsquo;s feet; yet both are indispensably necessary,
since <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>without faith there is no pleasing God, and that faith
which hath not works can save no man.&nbsp; This distinction, and
the truths which arise from it, you will find vindicated in the
11th, 12th, and 13th articles of the Church of England.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; As to faith and repentance, if men, when they call
them the conditions of salvation, only mean, that we cannot be
saved without them, in this point of view we perfectly
agree.&nbsp; But if, under these terms, is conveyed an
insinuation, either that they are performed by any power of the
creature, or possess such a degree of merit, as to be
intrinsically conditional of salvation, which I fear is often
intended, we then enter our protest against not only the
inaccuracy, but the dangerous error, couched under the
expression.&nbsp; Both repentance and faith are the gifts of
God.&nbsp; What is given, cannot be a condition of the love of
the giver; but must be the effect of it.&nbsp; It is the greatest
solecism in divinity and common sense, to say, that the favors
bestowed are the conditions of antecedent affection.&nbsp; As
well might we argue, that the effects produced in the earth by
the sun&rsquo;s rays, are the condition of his existence as the
source of light and heat.&nbsp; Whereas the very reverse is
true.&nbsp; The light of the universe, and the fertility of the
earth, depend upon the influence of that <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>great
luminary; without which, the world would be a dungeon, and all
creation a blank.&nbsp; Thus the Lord Jesus Christ shines in the
firmament of his church as the Sun of Righteousness.&nbsp; The
light of faith and the renovating influence of repentance, are
those beneficial rays which he emits, as tokens of his love and
power.&nbsp; The effects produced prove to individuals that this
Sun shineth; but they do not make him shine.&nbsp; His glory is
independent, as his goodness is undeserved.&nbsp; Besides, as the
power to believe and repent, is from God, Acts, v. 31, John, vi.
29, these acts of the mind can possess no merit or proper
conditionally, unless it can be supposed that a sinner has a
right to expect heaven for what is not his own.&nbsp; And when so
much is attributed to faith and repentance, the great object of
both is forgotten.&nbsp; And that object is the Lord our
righteousness; whose obedience and death were the great
conditions of reconciliation; without which, one sinner could not
have been saved.&nbsp; When we talk of the conditions of
salvation, we should, therefore, remember, that &ldquo;to do the
will of the Father,&rdquo; which implies the performance of these
conditions, is represented in Psal. xl. 6, and Heb. x. 9, as the
sole work of the Redeemer.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; We conceive it to be of the utmost importance, as
well for the consistency of the gospel <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>plan, as the happiness of sinners, to
maintain the necessity of a <i>divine inspiration</i>; not for
the purpose of working miracles, as some absurdly imagine that
expression always implies; but for the purpose of effecting that
great change in the heart, without which, none can enter the
kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; A change so difficult to produce, that
it is called in scripture a new birth, John, iii. 7; a new
creation, 2 Cor. v. 17; a translation from darkness to light, and
from the kingdom of Satan to the kingdom of Christ; and that
requires an exertion of the same omnipotent power that brought
light out of darkness in the beginning, and arranged the universe
itself.&nbsp; When St. Paul says, that &ldquo;if any man have not
the spirit of Christ, he is none of his,&rdquo; Rom. viii. 9, we
apprehend the apostle declares an awful truth, that not only
affected his cotemporaries, but in which all are concerned to the
end of time.&nbsp; And since the world as much wants now to be
&ldquo;convinced of sin, of righteousness, and of
judgment,&rdquo; John, xvi. 8, as in the day that our Lord
promised to send the Holy Ghost for these important purposes; it
is reasonable to conclude, that his inspiration is still
continued with the church, notwithstanding the opposition which
this truth meets with from multitudes, many of whom call
<i>that</i> enthusiasm, which they are taught to pray for in <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>the services
of the church.&nbsp; But the misfortune is, they make their own
stupid feelings a comment upon those of others; and the force of
their arguing centres entirely in this, that the influences of
the spirit must have ceased, because they never felt them.&nbsp;
Which is reasoning, just as wise and conclusive, as if a man born
blind should insist that there is no such colour as scarlet,
because he never saw it.</p>
<p>Thus have I endeavoured to give you a summary of the truths of
God, which, like the several links in a chain, are so closely
connected, that whatever affects one, endangers more or less the
whole system; while, to maintain the distinct authority of each,
and to point out its coherence with every concomitant link in the
golden chain of evangelical truth, must necessarily tend to the
preservation of the whole.&nbsp; But it remains now that I shew
that,</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The system of doctrine I have laid down, is no more
justly chargeable with novelty than with error.</p>
<p>To urge antiquity alone, as a sufficient recommendation of any
doctrine, is often the refuge of superstition driven to its last
resource.&nbsp; And it is well known how much this plea is
maintained by the Church of Rome, as a covert for all the errors,
impositions, and pious frauds, that for centuries have banished
purity and <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>truth from her communion.&nbsp; The plea of antiquity is
but a fallacious one at best; since error is very old as well as
truth, and in every age of the church men have always called in
the suffrage of their ancestors as a sort of sanction for their
own blasphemies; imputing to antiquity a certain virtue to make
error venerable, or to stamp a dignity on folly, merely because
it may have happened to be folly before the flood.&nbsp; Equally
inconclusive and fallacious too, are either the objections
started against any doctrine, or the countenance sought in favor
of it, merely because it may be new.&nbsp; People are apt, in
most cases, to be strangely wedded to antiquity; insomuch, that a
friendly effort to rescue them even from nonsense, or to liberate
them from slavery, has been at different times construed into a
dangerous innovation.&nbsp; When men have been habituated to an
old track, they become in time so reconciled to it, that what
with indolence and a stupid predilection in favor of antiquity,
they discover an unwillingness to be driven out of it.&nbsp; And
the man that has courage enough to make the attempt, does it
often at his peril.&nbsp; The person that first declared there
were any such beings as <i>antipodes</i>, was put to death as a
monster of wickedness.&nbsp; The discovery was new; and the mere
novelty was enough, in the opinion of a <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>sage pope, to
constitute him a heretic, and judge him worthy of death.&nbsp;
Yet, it seems necessary to guard with proper caution against the
pretensions of novelty.&nbsp; Men are often ambitious of making
new discoveries in religion, as well as in other sciences.&nbsp;
And when long established truth in the scriptures checks them in
their bold attempts to advance any thing absolutely new, they
will often put ingenuity upon the rack, at least, to devise some
new refinement upon an old error, that they may set themselves at
the head of a party, and rear their own consequence upon the
ruins of truth and peace.&nbsp; A bigot of this class has more
than once complained bitterly, that, &ldquo;in the Church of
England, there is nothing new left to be found out in religion;
but that the 39 articles tell all.&rdquo;&nbsp; As if religion
were a fluctuating system, that requires to be changed and
improved like fashions of a day.</p>
<p>From these observations it is plain, that the pleas, both of
antiquity and novelty, either for or against any thing, are
indecisive, and may be dangerous; and that when any doctrines are
proposed to us, our principal inquiry should be, not whether they
are new or old, but whether they are <i>true</i>.&nbsp; It is not
the <i>date</i> of a bond that gives it its validity in law, but
the sign manual, and the attestation of witnesses.&nbsp; Who ever
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>thought of
inquiring, <i>when</i> a piece of money was coined, provided the
metal were pure, and its currency legal.&nbsp; Gold is the same
in every age; and none would think it more intrinsically
valuable, either for the antiquity or novelty of its
coinage.&nbsp; So, the nature of truth cannot be affected by any
accidental circumstances of date, time, and place; and all, who
are in search of it, merely for its own sake, will make no
account of such trivial considerations.&nbsp; However, as
prejudices are sometimes best removed by being a little humoured
in their requisitions, capricious as they are, I will endeavour
to shew that the truths I have stated, claim antiquity as well as
purity for the ground of their excellency.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; If the writings of Moses may be considered among the
most venerable and authentic records, I think I can prove my
point even from the Pentateuch.&nbsp; A plural substantive and
verb singular in the very first verse in the Bible, united in a
description of the act and agent in creation, convey, if not a
direct proof, yet a very strong intimation, of a plurality of
persons in the Godhead, and of their oneness in point of
essence.&nbsp; But that truth is more expressly declared, when
upon the fall of man Jehovah says, &ldquo;The man is become as
one of us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gen. iii. 22.&mdash;The history of the
first transgression is recorded <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>in the same chapter.&nbsp; And the
effects of it soon appeared in the murder committed by Cain
against his own brother, and in the flagrant wickedness of one of
his descendants, that infamous polygamist Lamech.&nbsp; The
communication of the original taint from father to son is so
expressly recorded by Moses, that when St. Paul says, that
&ldquo;by one man&rsquo;s disobedience many were made
sinners,&rdquo; he does not speak more intelligibly, than when
the Jewish Lawgiver says, that &ldquo;Adam begat a son in his own
likeness;&rdquo; Gen. v. 3,&mdash;&ldquo;in his own,&rdquo; as
contradistinguished from the divine image, in which he had been
created.&nbsp; What words can more forcibly describe the total
and desperate apostacy of the human heart, than the
following?&nbsp; &ldquo;And God saw that <i>every</i> imagination
of the thoughts of man&rsquo;s heart was <i>only</i> evil
<i>continually</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gen. vi. 5.&nbsp; And what was
the universal deluge, but a tremendous comment on this
humiliating truth?&nbsp; And, lest it should be presumed, that
postdeluvian wickedness was less flagrant than that which
provoked God to destroy the inhabitants of the earth with a
flood, or, that human nature was materially altered for the
better, David says, that &ldquo;God looked down from heaven upon
the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand
and seek God.&nbsp; But, behold! they are <i>all</i> gone aside,
there <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>is
none that doeth good, no <i>not one</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. xiv.
2, 3.&nbsp; A passage of scripture this, which the Apostle Paul
quotes in Rom. iii. &ldquo;to prove that both Jews and Gentiles
are <i>all under sin</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. iii. 9.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The appointment of sacrifices, as typifying the way
of salvation through Christ, appears to have been one of
Jehovah&rsquo;s earliest institutions after the fall.&nbsp; For
the flesh of those animals, with the skins of which the Lord God
clothed our first parents, was probably offered up as a
sacrifice; the one, prefigurative of the expiatory death of
Christ, and the other, of the imputation of his righteousness,
that best robe, with which the nakedness of guilty sinners is
covered from the eye of God&rsquo;s justice.&nbsp; This
supposition respecting the appointment of sacrifices immediately
after the fall, appears to be confirmed by the conduct of
Abel.&nbsp; The great characteristic of his piety consisted in
the presenting to the Lord &ldquo;of the firstlings of the
flock.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gen. iv. 4.&nbsp; This act, which implied a
consciousness of his guilt, and a dependence on the great
propitiation of the Messiah, was done in faith; and, therefore,
&ldquo;Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
Cain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Heb. xi. 4.&nbsp; The same institution, which
Jehovah appointed to Adam and his household, and was continued
through the patriarchal &aelig;ra, <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>became at last one of the principal
ceremonies in the law of Moses.&nbsp; The necessity of an
atonement for sin was promulgated in every beast that was slain;
and the great truth was not only kept up by the solemnity of an
annual festival, but also by a daily sacrifice.&nbsp; The blood
poured forth upon these occasions was called the blood of
atonement.&nbsp; The constant repetition of sacrifices was
intended to preach that unalterable maxim, common both to the law
and the gospel, that &ldquo;without shedding of blood is no
remission.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what the economy of Moses exhibited
in shadowy types, was at last illustrated substantially in the
person of the Lord Jesus Christ, who &ldquo;hath offered one
sacrifice for sin, and hath put it away by the offering of
himself once for all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Heb. x. 12.&nbsp; So that both
law and gospel unite in proclaiming to the inhabitants of the
earth, that &ldquo;there is none other name under heaven given
among men, whereby we must be saved;&rdquo; but the
all-meritorious name of the Lamb of God.&nbsp; Acts, iv. 12.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; If we require the testimony of the prophets, their
unanimous suffrage is ready to confirm the truths I am pleading
for.&mdash;Can the doctrine of <i>original sin</i> be more
explicitly or feelingly taught, than in the confession of the
Royal Psalmist?&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold I was shapen in iniquity, <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>and in sin
did my mother conceive me!&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. li. 5; or, than in
the description of the human heart by Jeremiah?&nbsp; &ldquo;The
heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked; who
can know it?&rdquo;&nbsp; Jer. xvii 9.&nbsp; The glory of the
Lord of hosts in Isaiah&rsquo;s vision, (chapter vi. compared
with John, xii. 41, and Acts, xxviii. 25,) was the glory of the
Trinity: and what words can more expressly or more sublimely
delineate the divine nature of Jesus, than those of this
enraptured prophet, when he styles him &ldquo;Wonderful,
Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of
Peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isa. ix. 6.&nbsp; The same inspired writer,
who is very justly styled the evangelist of the prophets,
declares, in language equally intelligible and sublime, the
doctrine of our Lord&rsquo;s vicarious satisfaction, of the
translation of our guilt to him, and of his righteousness to us,
in his 53d chapter.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the Lord laid on him the
iniquity of us all&mdash;for the transgression of my people was
he smitten&mdash;by the knowledge of him shall my righteous
servant justify many; for he shall bear their
iniquities.&rdquo;&nbsp; Verse 6, 8, 11.&nbsp; The same truth is
taught by <i>Daniel</i>, when he prophesies, that &ldquo;Messiah
should be cut off, but not for himself; that he should make
reconciliation for iniquity, and bring in everlasting
righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dan. ix. 24, 26.&nbsp;
<i>Zechariah</i> speaks of <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>the sword of justice as drawn against
the &ldquo;man that was Jehovah&rsquo;s fellow,&rdquo; and of the
&ldquo;fountain of his blood opened for sin and
uncleanness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Zech. xiii. 1, 7.&nbsp; When we assert
that sinners are justified before God, only by the righteousness
of the Lord Jesus, apprehended by faith, to the exclusion of all
works in point of merit, we think ourselves authorized to do so
by the authority of the prophets and of the apostles.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is his name,&rdquo; says Jeremiah, &ldquo;whereby he
shall be called the Lord our Righteousness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jer.
xxiii. 6.&nbsp; And Habakkuk speaks the same truth, when he says,
that &ldquo;the just shall live by faith,&rdquo; Habak. ii. 4,
compared with Heb. x. 38.&nbsp; The work of the Holy Ghost, for
the purpose of cleansing the heart from the love of sin and the
dominion of inward idols, is described by Ezekiel under the
similitude of applying clean water to the body.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then
will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
clean&mdash;a new heart also will I give you&mdash;and I will put
my spirit within you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ezek. xxxvi.
25&ndash;27.&nbsp; The same divine agency is by Malachi compared
to the operation of fire on metal, to purify it from any adherent
dross: Mal. iii. 3.&nbsp; And our blessed Lord himself hath
compared the Spirit&rsquo;s influence to the effects produced by
these two elements respectively.&nbsp; To all these, we may
superadd the testimony of Joel: &ldquo;And it shall <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>come to pass
afterward, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all
flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Joel, ii. 28.&nbsp; For though this promise,
as quoted by Peter in Acts, ii. 17, relates principally to the
miraculous effusion of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost,
yet it comprehends also a prediction of his saving influences to
all that believe among Jews and Gentiles.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; That God hath loved his people from everlasting, Jer.
xxxi. 3,&mdash;that he will &ldquo;rest in his love,&rdquo; Zeph.
iii. 17, without variableness or shadow of turning&mdash;that
&ldquo;he knoweth,&rdquo; with a peculiar and discriminating
knowledge, &ldquo;them that trust in him,&rdquo; Nab. i.
7,&mdash;that &ldquo;he delighteth in mercy, and passeth by the
transgression of the remnant of his heritage,&rdquo; Mic. vii.
18,&mdash;that &ldquo;salvation is of the Lord,&rdquo; Jonah, ii.
9, and must be a glorious certainty, since its contrivance and
execution are both the Lord&rsquo;s&mdash;that he will
&ldquo;bring again the captivity of his people,&rdquo; Amos,
viii. 14, and &ldquo;heal their backslidings, and love them
freely,&rdquo; Hos. xiv. 4,&mdash;that &ldquo;the mountains shall
depart, and the hills be removed, but that the kindness of the
Lord shall not depart from his people, nor the covenant of his
peace be removed,&rdquo; Isa. liv. 10,&mdash;are glorious truths,
expressed in scripture language, and corroborated by the
concurring testimony of the prophets Jeremiah, Zephaniah, <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>Nahum, Micah,
Jonah, Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah.</p>
<p>As I have already made an appeal to the inspired writers of
the New Testament, I shall not reiterate their testimony; though,
as it is so very copious, it would be no difficult matter to
produce new and additional evidence to authenticate the great
doctrines which I have undertaken to defend.&nbsp; Suffice it to
observe, that if revelation had been confined to the contents of
the 6th, 10th, and 17th of St. John&rsquo;s gospel; from those
three chapters alone we might collect materials sufficient for
laying the foundation, and rearing the superstructure, of the
temple of truth.&nbsp; In that small portion of sacred scripture
you have the whole gospel epitomized; and that, not by the
opinion of an apostle, but by the infallible authority of that
great Prophet, &ldquo;who spake as never man spake,&rdquo; and
from whose judgment there can lie no appeal.</p>
<p>It would be a task far from difficult to collect the opinion
of the primitive Fathers on these subjects, and to point out
their coincidence with the doctrines of the established
church.&nbsp; Those of them that flourished nearest to the days
of the apostles, such as Tertullian, Iren&aelig;us, Justin
Martyr, &amp;c. and those venerable ecclesiastics that presided
at the council of Nice <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>in Bithynia, and united, at the
instance of Constantine the Great, in condemning the heresy of
Arius; or the not less respectable names of Augustin and Hierom,
who so ably defended the truth against the subtleties and errors
of Pelagius;&mdash;are authorities in our favor, not only
venerable for their antiquity, but, what is more valuable, for
the purity and consistency of those systems, in which they guard
the truth and combat error, even when abetted by such
her&aelig;siarchs as Arius and Pelagius; the former at the head
of those, who blaspheme the Deity of the Son of God; and the
latter, of those that deny the fall.&nbsp; But, to come nearer
home.&nbsp; In the reign of James I. several of our English
bishops were sent over by that monarch to the synod of Dort,
which was convened for the purpose of examining and condemning
the tenets of Arminius.&nbsp; Among these the names of Bishop
Hall, and Davenant, shine with distinguished lustre.&nbsp; In the
reigns of Edward the VIth, and Queen Elizabeth, the doctrines
contained in the 39 articles, and the two books of
<i>homilies</i>, received the sanction of both houses of
parliament; and the former were compiled expressly for the
purpose of &ldquo;avoiding diversity of opinions.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The doctrines contained in them receive no small recommendation
from such excellent reformers as Cranmer, Latimer, Ridley, <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>Hooper; men
that sealed the truth with their blood.&nbsp; Let any man of
common honesty and candor but read over the homilies and
articles, and then say, whether they do not avow, as consonant to
the sacred scriptures, those tenets, which, by many, and even by
persons that have subscribed them, are, in the present day,
branded with terms the most opprobrious.&nbsp; I appeal to the
common sense of any man, whether the 1<i>st</i> <i>Article</i>
does not expressly and unequivocally receive the doctrine of
<i>the Trinity</i>&mdash;the 2d, the divinity and
consubstantiality of the Son with the Father&mdash;the 9th, the
doctrine of <i>original sin</i>&mdash;the 10th, the inability of
the human will without the prevenient operation of the grace of
Christ&mdash;the 11th, the nature of <i>justification</i>, not by
works, but by the merits of Christ&mdash;the 13th, the
inefficacy, and even sinfulness, of works antecedent to
&ldquo;the grace of Christ and the inspiration of his
Spirit&rdquo;&mdash;whether the 15th does not disavow the notion
of impeccability in this life&mdash;and whether the 17th does not
as expressly, but more copiously, and, if possible, more
unambiguously, state the doctrine of election.</p>
<p>A solemn subscription, and as unequivocal as solemn, to these
doctrines, is required of every man that commences a minister in
the establishment.&nbsp; As long as we preach these doctrines, <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>we act
consistently with the sincere attachment which we promised to her
interests.&nbsp; And will any person be bold enough to assert
that these doctrines are <i>new</i>? when they manifestly claim,
at least, the &aelig;ra of the reformation as a sanction for
their antiquity?&nbsp; Whether they be true or false, is not the
question immediately under consideration.&nbsp; <i>That</i> has
been discussed already.&nbsp; But are they <i>new</i>?&nbsp; Or,
are they not the discriminating doctrines of the Church of
England?&nbsp; If they are not, how came a number of the clergy a
few years ago to associate at a tavern, and there to project a
petition to parliament for easing their consciences from the
burden of subscribing them?&nbsp; And why do their brethren among
Arians and Socinians at this time so bitterly regret the
existence of these doctrines amongst us?&nbsp; I grant that to
two sorts of people they may appear new; either to those, who
never heard them before, or to such as &ldquo;are lost&rdquo; to
all the light and power of truth, &ldquo;in whom the God of this
world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the
light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God,
should shine unto them.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2 Cor. iv. 4.&nbsp; Or they
may be reputed so, by those who never took the trouble to read
the articles of their own church.&nbsp; And it is not a little
remarkable, <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>that they are most forward to bring this charge, who are
the most incompetent judges of the matter.</p>
<p>In order to do the work of Satan, and prejudice people&rsquo;s
minds against the truth, it has been the industrious contrivance
of some to call certain systems by some obnoxious epithet of
novelty, enthusiasm, or fanaticism.&nbsp; Whether these words
have some meaning, or none at all, is never inquired by the
vulgar.&nbsp; Nor does it appear to be ever the wish of those who
use them, to give any explanation of them.&nbsp; If they can only
frighten men from the truth, and the preachers of it, by the
bugbear of some obnoxious appellation; <i>they</i> are satisfied,
and so is the <i>devil</i> too.&nbsp; But the application of
hackneyed epithets, we esteem the effect of ignorance, want of
politeness and candor, and often the refuge of enmity against the
gospel; which, when disarmed of arguments, and stript of every
plea for its unreasonable opposition, at last flies to the
scorner&rsquo;s chair to call names, and vent the poison of asps
in calumniating and traducing, when it can do nothing more.&nbsp;
But &ldquo;none of these things move us; neither count we our
lives dear unto us, so that we might finish our course with joy;
and the ministry, which we have received of the Lord Jesus, to
testify the gospel of the grace of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Acts, xx.
24.</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>We
beg, however, brethren, it may be remembered, that the
application of any name, by which the laborious and faithful
ministers of Christ are distinguished from those who live in
indolence and luxurious ease, we esteem an honor; because we
recollect, that even the blessed Jesus himself, who &ldquo;went
about doing good,&rdquo; was nevertheless stigmatized with names
of the most diabolical import, and his apostles branded as men
&ldquo;that turned the world upside down.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, any
epithet that conveys the most distant idea of propagating
doctrines repugnant to those, which our reformers have given us
in the articles, homilies, and liturgy of our church; or any name
that implies any infringement on the constitution or discipline
of our most excellent establishment, we totally disavow; and I
must be excused, if I add, that to call men, who are so warmly
attached to the interests of the Church of England, by names that
imply the contrary, is both unjust and invidious.&nbsp; Although
we honor many, who happen not to be within the pale of the
establishment, and love all, who love our Lord Jesus Christ in
sincerity, by whatever denomination they may be distinguished,
(for, difference in non-essentials ought to be no bar to
Christian Catholicism among the common friends of truth,) yet we
profess to be of no party, and to call no man master upon <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>earth, but
the great Prophet and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus
the Lord.&nbsp; The very summit of our ambition is to acquit
ourselves as faithful embassadors of the Prince of Peace, and to
see the interests of the everlasting gospel crowned with
prosperity, in the conversion of sinners.&nbsp; Compared with
this great end of our function, the consideration of worldly
emoluments, or human applause, is lighter than vanity itself:
for, to an enlightened minister of Christ, the salvation of
immortal souls from sin and hell, is an event of infinitely
greater moment than the temporal salvation of kingdoms and
empires.&nbsp; To this great event he wishes to direct all his
studies, prayers, and exhortations; and rejoices to spend and be
spent, if haply he may be instrumental in saving one sinner from
the damnation of hell.&nbsp; If, in the delivery of his message,
any thing should seem <i>new</i>, as to <i>matter</i> or
<i>manner</i>, the novelty is rather eventual than real.&nbsp;
When the cause of God, and the interests of souls, are under
consideration, who can help being in earnest?&nbsp; The highest
degree of pathos, which sentiment, expression, and gesture
united, can arrive at, will always fall far below the dignity of
our subject, and the solemnity of our charge, when called to
address an assembly of dying mortals, and to declare to them the
whole counsel of God.&nbsp; However, <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>without controverting the objections
made to a particular manner of conveying gospel truths, we do
insist that the matter is agreeable to the system we solemnly
subscribed at our ordination; and we defy any man living to
prove, that the doctrines I have this day delivered, are
<i>new</i>; unless the charge of novelty can be brought against
the doctrines of the reformation.&nbsp; Examine them, brethren,
with care and coolness of temper.&nbsp; Compare them with the
scriptures, first; and then read over the 39 articles.&nbsp; If
you love truth, you will do the first.&nbsp; If you love the
Church of England, you will do the last.&nbsp; And if you have
any pretension to candor of inquiry, or solicitude about your
everlasting interests, you will not desist; till you have found
an answer to Pilate&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;What is
truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider what I say; and the Lord give you
understanding in all things!&rdquo;&nbsp; 2 Tim. ii. 7.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">THE NATURE
AND NECESSITY OF GIVING THE HEART TO GOD, CONSIDERED AND
ENFORCED.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">[Preached at Nantwich, July 1,
1781.]</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>My son</i>, <i>give me thine
heart</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Prov</span>. xxiii.
26.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a very strong proof of the
depravity of human nature, that the most persuasive arguments,
that revelation itself can furnish, are insufficient to induce
the children of men to seek the things that belong to their
everlasting peace.&nbsp; When the world calls, and secular
interest prompts, they want no spur to their assiduity, no
incentive to their zeal.&nbsp; The greatest toil is sustained
with cheerfulness, difficulties apparently insuperable are
surmounted with ease, and no degree of solicitude is deemed
excessive, although in the ardor of pursuit, the only object that
presents itself, is either the fascinating phantom of pleasure,
the accursed lure of gold, or the bubble of worldly honor, which
often is <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>burst by the same uncertain breath that inflated
it.&nbsp; But when God calls, either in the menacing language of
incensed majesty, or in the attractive voice of parental mercy
and pity; how slow to hear are the insensible creatures that are
addressed! how unwilling to yield obedience to a call, that
invites them to happiness, to heaven!&nbsp; Although the way into
which they are solicited to enter, and walk, is the path of
glory, honor, and immortality; yet how many objections are made,
how many difficulties started, to impede or intimidate the heart
in a pursuit of its best, its eternal interests!&nbsp; And,
although present peace, as an earnest of permanent bliss in
reversion; a sense of the divine favor, as a pledge of one day
entering his kingdom; all the unsearchable riches of grace, and
all the inexhaustible treasures of glory, are the substantial
blessings held forth to sinners in the gospel of the blessed God;
yet, how strangely is all this profusion of grace and goodness
overlooked or contemned, even by those who are most interested in
it!&nbsp; In the eyes of multitudes, worldly vanities possess
more intrinsic charms than the eternal realities of the invisible
world; He, who is &ldquo;altogether lovely,&rdquo; has no form or
comeliness, in the opinion of the gay, the proud, and the
self-righteous; and all the glories of heaven itself are so
depreciated in the estimate <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>of deluded mortals, that, in their
false balance, a feather outweighs a kingdom, and a never-dying
soul is of less value than the bread that perisheth.</p>
<p>An infatuation of so gross and of so perilous a nature, can
arise only from some dreadful evil latent in the innermost
recesses of the mind.&nbsp; This evil is <i>sin</i>, which hath
depraved the soul&rsquo;s noblest faculties, and given it a
corrupt bias, by which it is disinclined to that which is good,
and precipitated to that which is evil.&nbsp; Otherwise, men
would never act with such fatal inconsistency, as they appear
universally to do, when the objects proposed to their choice are
the temporary pleasures of sin on the one hand, and the
unsearchable riches of Christ on the other.&nbsp; Were not
something dreadfully amiss within, the human mind would not be so
totally blind to its own favorite principle, self-interest, as to
admit its weight, when worldly acquisitions are in view, and yet
forget it, when even a vast eternity is at stake.&nbsp; What, but
the utmost carnality and depravation of heart, can make men fly
in their Maker&rsquo;s face, or rush upon the thick bosses of his
buckler, by trampling under foot, what it is their duty and
happiness to observe and reverence!&nbsp; And what, but the very
foolishness of folly, can prompt them to prefer the slavery of
the devil to the liberty of the sons <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>of God!&nbsp; Or what, but the most
vitiated taste, can make them relish the foulest dregs of
sensuality, and discover no thirst for those rivers of pleasure,
that flow deep and pure at God&rsquo;s right hand!</p>
<p>Whatever the Father of mercies enjoins, must be a transcript
of his law,&mdash;holy, just, and good.&nbsp; His counsels are
replete with wisdom, and are admirably directed to the great end
of making us better and happier.&nbsp; His service is founded
upon principles the most highly reasonable, and leads to bliss of
the most permanent nature.&nbsp; When he commands, he consults
our good; and when he threatens, no less than when he promises,
his end is to save.&nbsp; When he demands any thing of us, he
only asks his own; and acquiescence here is salvation.&nbsp; And
what but the most perverse repugnancy to the divine will can ever
prevent us from complying with proposals, that equally involve in
them our own happiness and the glory of God?&nbsp; O the hardness
of the heart of man, that can make him a foe to himself, and an
enemy to his God!&nbsp; Can any demand, for instance, be couched
in terms more reasonable or more captivating, than those in our
text? whether we suppose them as the affectionate request of
Solomon to his son, or, as the tender and just requisition of one
greater than Solomon to the sons of men?&nbsp; Hath not <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>God an
indisputable right to our hearts?&nbsp; Is not his claim to them
founded on reasons that derive their strength and cogency from
the greatest and most gracious works of <span
class="smcap">Jehovah</span>?&nbsp; Ask creation; consult all the
dispensations of providence; but especially that grand
dispensation of grace and mercy in the gospel; and then say, who
ought to have our hearts, but He, who made them, and bled for
them?&nbsp; Oh! that when the important question is put,
&ldquo;Who amongst us will give God, the Creator, Preserver, and
Redeemer of men his heart?&rdquo; there may not be one negative
voice in this assembly!&nbsp; And may he, who hath all power both
in heaven and in earth, &ldquo;who openeth and no man
shutteth,&rdquo; effectually conquer every prejudice against the
truth, while I proceed to consider; <i>First</i>, What is implied
in giving the heart to God; <i>Secondly</i>, The tempers which
ought to actuate us in making the surrender; <i>Thirdly</i>, The
necessity of doing this, principally arising from the natural
state of the heart; <i>Fourthly</i>, The motives to induce us to
comply with God&rsquo;s reasonable demand.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; What is implied in giving the heart to God?&nbsp;
Now, in order to complete this important surrender, it is
indispensably requisite, that unruly appetites should be subdued,
and the most beloved lusts sacrificed;&mdash;the alienated
affections <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>restored to their original claimant, and set upon God
as their supreme object,&mdash;and an outward evidence of the
truth of this dedication be given, in an habitual consecration of
our corporeal faculties, our time, health, families, fortune,
&amp;c. to the honor and service of the Lord.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; It implies the conquest of passions, and the
sacrifice of the most beloved lusts.&nbsp; These in the heart are
like rebels in a state.&nbsp; They usurp the chief power; and,
while they domineer, there &ldquo;is confusion and every evil
work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Reason is subjected to the loose reins of
impetuous passion.&nbsp; God, the rightful sovereign, is
dethroned.&nbsp; His law is violated.&nbsp; His will
despised.&nbsp; While Satan, that infernal usurper, gives laws to
every faculty, and &ldquo;leads the heart captive at his
will.&rdquo;&nbsp; And what renders this scene of anarchy and
rebellion the more melancholy, is, that the heart naturally hugs
its own chains, and delights to feed the vipers that spread
poison and death through all its powers.&nbsp; From hence arises
the cordial love of sin, and a delight in those sinful
propensities, which lead to endless ruin.&nbsp; And from hence
arises the difficulty of giving the heart to God: because it is
requisite that every inordinate pursuit be checked, every
tyrannical passion bridled, and every sin, whether gainful, or
constitutional, or fashionable, be mortified, before the heart
can <a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>be
emancipated from its slavery.&nbsp; For, how can it be free,
while the tyrant sin reigns in it?&nbsp; Let none, therefore,
boast of liberty, until the predominant lusts that lead him
captive are given up, and sacrificed at the foot of the
cross.&nbsp; Neither let any suppose, unless they wish to flatter
themselves to their ruin, that their hearts are right with God,
so long as they harbour internal adversaries, which he
hateth.&nbsp; As well might they attempt to reconcile light and
darkness, Christ and Belial, together; or to make the liberty of
a Briton consist with the thraldom of a galley slave.</p>
<p>And here it seems necessary to observe, that our renunciation
of sin must extend not to gross indulgences merely, but to
spiritual wickedness, to internal favorite lusts, to the secret
working of which no eye is privy, but God&rsquo;s and our
own.&nbsp; Though the parting with them should exceed the pain
that attends &ldquo;the plucking out a right eye, or cutting off
a right arm,&rdquo; the one the most tender organ, and the other
the most useful member in the human frame; yet they must be given
up; and not some, but all.&nbsp; Thus it is written: &ldquo;O
Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be
saved!&nbsp; How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within
thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; Jer. iv. 14.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whosoever will come
after me, let him deny himself, and take up his <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>cross, and
follow me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mark, viii. 34.&nbsp; No man, therefore,
can be said to have given his heart to God, until he hath given
up his sins, and until his heart hath been cleansed from the
guilt, and rescued from the tyrannical sway of those vicious
inclinations, by which he had been made the miserable dupe of
Satan and the world.</p>
<p>It would incur equal danger and absurdity for any man to
conclude that he is a partaker of the blessing recommended in our
text, either because he may have <i>outwardly reformed</i>, or
desisted from sordid and impious gratifications <i>through
accident</i>.&nbsp; In the former case, the partial change is
effected by a mere regard to reputation, without any real love of
virtue, or hatred of sin; and thus a degree of outward
reformation, where the heart is not renovated in its leading
principles, may spring from pride, and perfectly consist with the
inherency of every corruption, which self-complacency and
formality can nurture.&nbsp; Or the apparent alteration may be
the result of that pain of mind, which is often occasioned by
embarrassed circumstances, a distempered constitution, or a
sullied reputation; and is not seldom produced by some temporary
pangs of legal remorse, or corrosions of natural
conscience.&nbsp; When the hand of the Lord was stretched out
against Pharaoh, he <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>seemed to relent and repent.&nbsp;
But no sooner were the desolating judgments removed, and the
apprehension of present danger ceased, but the impious tyrant
&ldquo;hardened his heart,&rdquo; and gave evident proof, that
service arising from servile fear is transient and deceitful, and
that the obedience of a slave and that of a son differ very
materially in this, that the one is permanent and voluntary, the
other temporary and compelled.&nbsp; Belshazzer was filled with
horror, when he beheld the awful hand-writing that announced his
approaching doom.&nbsp; Felix trembles, when Paul
&ldquo;reasons&rdquo; before him &ldquo;of righteousness,
temperance, and judgment to come.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Herod
&ldquo;did many things&rdquo; while he sat under the ministry of
John the Baptist.&nbsp; But not one of these men trembled or
acted to any saving purpose, because the secret attachment to the
most abandoned lusts remained.&nbsp; Sin was too sweet in an
adulterous heart to be given up for the awful warning of an
apostle, or the intrepid reproof of the illustrious forerunner of
the Son of God.&nbsp; So that many things may be done, and yet if
<i>one</i> thing be omitted,&mdash;if the <i>heart</i> be not
given to God&mdash;it annuls all the rest; and all the
concessions and seeming remorse extorted by present sufferings,
or the dread of future torments, are often as insincere as the
reformation produced by them is <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>superficial.&nbsp; Besides, let us
be extremely cautious how we conclude, that either ourselves or
others are safe, because a degree of outward decency or freedom
from grosser impieties may have taken place; since it is very
possible that one great evil may be exchanged for a
<i>greater</i>, and the <i>last</i> state of some sinners may be
worse than the <i>first</i>.&nbsp; Mat. xii. 43&ndash;45.&nbsp; A
sepulchre, whited and ornamented to a high degree, may
nevertheless be the seat of rottenness and putrefaction.&nbsp; So
a reformed licentiate, where the renovation of the <i>heart</i>
is wanting, has been often known to sink into the very dregs of
formality and self-righteousness, and to turn out a virulent
blasphemer of the most glorious and discriminating doctrines of
the gospel.&nbsp; If the <i>heart</i> be not washed from the
wickedness of domineering <i>pride</i>, <i>worldly
conformity</i>, <i>fear of man</i>, <i>self-conceit</i>, and
<i>unbelief</i>, to &ldquo;wash the outside of the cup and
platter,&rdquo; will avail nothing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cleanse
<i>first</i> that which is <span
class="GutSmall">WITHIN</span>,&rdquo; is our Lord&rsquo;s
direction.&nbsp; Mat. xxiii. 26.</p>
<p>As to the other case alluded to above, it often happens that a
degree of reformation may take place through accident, or the
unavoidable course of nature.&nbsp; This happens either through
old age, or those contingencies, which often suddenly deprive
some, of the means of gratifying their lusts.&nbsp; When the
vigor of constitution is <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>abated by declining age, or ruined
by a long series of debaucheries; when health sinks with the
lapse of time, or fortunes are exhausted by long extravagance;
the aged become chaste, and the young, sober, <i>through
necessity</i>.&nbsp; But neither, in numerous instances, forsake
their sins in reality.&nbsp; Their sins have only forsaken
<i>them</i>.&nbsp; This would appear evident to a demonstration,
were both only placed in the circumstances that once contributed
fuel to their passions.&nbsp; Were only youth, health, or
fortune, restored, the aged miser would again add his love of
lewdness to that of money, and the enfeebled or impoverished rake
return to all his juvenile voluptuousness, with greater ardor
than ever.&nbsp; Through all the varying circumstances of life,
the heart of an unconverted sinner is still the same, and the
sinner himself would be the same, if no such variation occurred,
by which his pursuits are circumscribed, or his line of sinning
altered.&nbsp; But where the heart is really transformed, former
lusts are hated; the remembrance of sin is grievous; the burden
of it is intolerable; and a desire to mortify it is deeply
rooted, and universal..&nbsp; Pure principles are
implanted.&nbsp; Noble passions predominate.&nbsp; Sublime
desires and spiritual appetites attract the heart to God, and fix
the conversation in heaven.&nbsp; From <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>whence it
arises, that to give the heart to God implies,</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A restoration of the alienated affections to their
original claimant, and a placing of them upon God as their
supreme object.</p>
<p>The heart is the seat of the affections; and the principal of
these is <i>love</i>.&nbsp; According to the nature of the
object, or the degree with which some objects are pursued, this
affection becomes either innocent or criminal, sordid or
sublime.&nbsp; If sin in general be the object, love is then the
most diabolical passion, and pollutes every other faculty of the
mind.&nbsp; Before the fall, it was the glory and happiness of
man to love God perfectly and incessantly.&nbsp; Since that
melancholy event, it is his misfortune to be under the influence
of a &ldquo;carnal mind &phi;&rho;&omicron;&nu;&eta;&mu;&alpha;
&sigma;&alpha;&rho;&xi; that is <i>enmity</i> against God, and is
not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. viii. 7.&nbsp; Hence flows an innate
propensity to love the world, and from the ignorance and pride of
the heart to idolize <i>self</i>.&nbsp; This alienation of the
affections is, in scripture, called adultery; and they who love
the world rather than God, are branded, in the same unflattering,
pages, with the odious epithet of &ldquo;adulterers and
adulteresses.&rdquo;&nbsp; James, iv. 4.&nbsp; It matters not,
<i>what</i> the thing is, to which we give a primary place in <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>our
affections; even though it may be a necessary, an useful, a
lawful, or even an amiable object, yet if it be loved
inordinately, or with a supreme affection, it instantly becomes
an idol: insomuch that our Lord saith, &ldquo;He that loveth
<i>father</i> or <i>mother</i>, <i>son</i> or <i>daughter</i>,
more than me, is not worthy of me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mat. x. 37.&nbsp;
Things unlawful, or of moral turpitude, are not to be loved at
all.&nbsp; And things lawful are only to be loved in a certain
degree.&nbsp; It is not the <i>love</i> of these last that is
sinful; but the <i>excess</i> or inordinacy of that love.&nbsp;
In giving the heart to God, or restoring the idolatrous
alienation of the affections to him, <i>that</i> is given back
which was originally his property.&nbsp; He then possesses the
supreme affection, delight, and homage of the heart;&mdash;is the
centre of its wishes, and the spring of its comforts.&nbsp; This
is called &ldquo;yielding ourselves to the Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2
Chron. xxx. 8.&nbsp; And the grateful language of such a solemn
surrender is, &ldquo;Whom have I in heaven but <span
class="smcap">Thee</span>? and there is none upon earth that I
desire beside <span class="smcap">Thee</span>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal.
lxxiii. 25.</p>
<p>Where the affections are thus gained over, the other sublime
faculties follow of course.&nbsp; The contrariety of the will is
broken, and made to bend in submission to the divine will.&nbsp;
Reason resigns its pretensions to the sacred authority of
revelation; and the intellectual powers <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>are
extricated from the teeming darkness of nature, and brought, by
the irradiating spirit, into the bright regions of light and
liberty.&nbsp; And the memory is so sanctified as to become the
faithful repository of sacred truth.&nbsp; Conscience is
reinstated in her viceregency in the soul; and being cleansed by
the blood of Christ from the guilt and pollution of sin,
establishes peace in the heart, and pours the balm of pardoning
love into all its wounds.&nbsp; All the passions are made the
willing captives of the prince of peace; and instead of rending
the heart with their impetuous and clashing propensities, unite
in forming concord and harmony there, by exerting their
respective powers in subordination to the grace of God.&nbsp;
Thus fear, joy, desire, hope, anger, sorrow, hatred, are no
longer so many noxious springs fraught with impoisoned waters,
but convey to the heart, in their respective streams, the health
and purity which they have derived from the fountain of
life.&nbsp; Those things are dreaded, which had been once pursued
with eagerness.&nbsp; Indignation burns against once beloved
idols; and affection fixes on objects, that had formerly been
rejected with scorn and contempt.&nbsp; The heart weeps over what
it once rejoiced in; and bleeds at the remembrance of those
things, which, but lately, perhaps, were the spring of all its
shallow and unholy mirth.&nbsp; <a name="page117"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 117</span>Objects are now desired insatiably,
for which the heart never before panted, and upon which the mind
never bestowed one serious thought.&nbsp; Instead of living under
the anguish of worldly disappointments, hope now plumes her
golden wing, and stretches with a nobler flight towards the
confines of a glorious eternity; leaves the sordid trash of earth
below, and soars in joyful anticipation of heavenly
realities.&nbsp; The slavish fear of the creature gives place to
the filial fear of God; and he who was awed by the frown of a
worm like himself, now reveres the great Omnipotent, who hath
power to destroy both body and soul in hell.&nbsp; The love of
the world is expelled by the love of Jesus; and the lusts of the
flesh, the lusts of the eye, and the pride of life, all lose
their charms, or rather appear infinitely odious, when compared
with even the reproach of the cross, much more when contrasted
with the happy prospect of a crown of glory.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;sorrow of the world, which worketh death,&rdquo; is
exchanged for that godly sorrow, which worketh repentance unto
life; and &ldquo;joy unspeakable and full of glory,&rdquo;
succeeds the bitterness of conviction of sin, and brings a
foretaste of heaven.&nbsp; God, whom the heart once hated, and
the sinner shunned, is contemplated in all his august and amiable
perfections, with delight and wonder; while the humble <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>believer,
enraptured with a view of him as reconciled to him in the Son of
his love, gives vent to the fulness of his heart in the most
glowing effusions of gratitude and astonishment.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;Thou my <i>All</i>!<br />
My theme! my inspiration! and my crown!<br />
My strength in age!&nbsp; My rise in low estate!<br />
My soul&rsquo;s ambition! pleasure! wealth! my world!<br />
My light in darkness! and my life in death!<br />
My boast thro&rsquo; time! bliss thro&rsquo; eternity!<br />
Eternity, too short to speak thy praise,<br />
Or fathom thy profound of love to man!<br />
To man, of men the meanest, ev&rsquo;n to <i>me</i>!<br />
My sacrifice!&nbsp; My God!&mdash;What things are
these!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span
class="smcap">Young</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.&nbsp; An outward evidence that the heart is given to God,
appears in the habitual consecration of the corporeal faculties,
of time, health, fortune, family, &amp;c. to the honor of
God.</p>
<p>As in every science some first rudiments or primary principles
must precede the attainment of complete knowledge; and in every
structure a foundation must be well chosen for the security of
what is to rest upon it; so, in the great concerns of religion,
some permanent principles must be rooted in the heart, before the
sacred superstructure of holiness and righteousness can be reared
in the life.&nbsp; Where the former are <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>implanted,
the latter will follow of course; as a good tree in a rich soil
will necessarily produce good fruit.&nbsp; But this fertilization
produced in the heart is the effect, not of natural goodness, but
of efficacious grace.&nbsp; When, therefore, the citadel is
stormed and taken, the outworks fall with it, in
consequence.&nbsp; So that, as soon as the heart is given to God,
outward fruits appear in the conversation; without which, nothing
can be more fallacious or fatal than the most towering
profession.&nbsp; And, therefore, in the clause that stands in
immediate connexion with the text, it is added, &ldquo;And let
thine eyes observe my ways.&rdquo;&nbsp; For, &ldquo;if any man
be in Christ he is a new creature; old things are passed away;
behold all things are become new.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2 Cor. v.
17.&nbsp; The conversation takes a new turn; and pure words and
true, issue from that mouth which was once filled with malice,
blasphemies, and uncleanness.&nbsp; The feet are swift to bear
the renewed sinner to the house of God, which once carried him to
the haunts of the profane.&nbsp; Health is no longer consumed in
the service of sin; nor time wasted on the egregious follies of
pleasure and dissipation.&nbsp; The body, once a co-partner with
the soul in rebellion against God, is now the sacred temple of
his in-dwelling Spirit; and all the members are now
&ldquo;yielded as servants to righteousness <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>unto
holiness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. vi. 19.&nbsp; And the principles,
which lead to this universal dedication, are arguments of its
genuineness, while they provide for its permanency: which reminds
me of the second general head, under which I proposed
considering,</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The manner or temper, which should actuate us in
making the surrender of all we have and are to the glory of
God.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; This great affair should be done
<i>solemnly</i>.&nbsp; If reciprocal acts of covenant and amity
among the children of men, require deliberation, and are executed
in a manner the most serious and binding, where only temporal
inheritances or transitory engagements are concerned; how much
more deliberate and solemn should that act be, whereby the soul
maintains an intercourse with the awful Majesty of Heaven, and
soul and body, with their respective functions, are surrendered
to the service of the Most High for ever! in which God is chosen
as the soul&rsquo;s portion, and every thing is to be sacrificed
to his injunctions, or given up to his care and
guardianship!&nbsp; O with what profound reverence and
self-abnegation should we make the tender of our hearts to Him,
when his majesty, or our vileness, is considered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Commune with your own heart, therefore, and in your
chamber,&rdquo; about this solemn act, and &ldquo;pay thy vows
unto <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>the
Most High.&rdquo;&nbsp; Count the cost of surrendering your heart
to him; since, without due reflection, you may be disappointed
and basely retract, when you hear that unless you deny yourself,
and take up your cross, you cannot be his disciple.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; No <i>reserve</i> must enter into any act of
dedication to God; much less into that, by which we restore him
his own property.&nbsp; He is a jealous God, and will have the
<i>whole</i> heart or none.&nbsp; He cannot, he will not bear a
rival.&nbsp; He must have the pre-eminence in the
affections.&nbsp; A divided heart is his abomination.&nbsp;
Remember how the Lord&rsquo;s anger was kindled against Saul,
because, when commanded to destroy the Amalekites, &ldquo;he
<i>spared</i> Agag and the <i>best</i> of the sheep, and all that
was <i>good</i>, and would not <i>utterly</i> destroy
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Sam. xv. 9.&nbsp; And ponder well the case
of the rich young man, in the gospel, who approached the Lord
Jesus with a seeming desire to give him his heart, but
&ldquo;went away sorrowful,&rdquo; when Jesus insisted on the
sacrifice of his bosom sin, and recommended the utility of taking
up the cross.&nbsp; It was upon that memorable occasion, that our
Lord said, &ldquo;A rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom
of heaven,&rdquo; Mat. xix. 23; that is, the difficulty of
entering heaven is great to all who have riches, and rises to an
impossibility, <a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>where they are trusted in, and idolized.&nbsp; And the
case is the same in every circumstance, where the heart is
divided between any thing and God.&nbsp; So that, if there be a
competitor within, that shares your affections, so as to rob
Jesus of his prerogative over them, be assured you are yet in
&ldquo;the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of
iniquity.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the idol, whether it be the love of
pleasure, or profit, or honor, or self, must be pulled down, or
it will dethrone Christ, and ruin your immortal souls.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The heart should be given up <i>cheerfully</i>.&nbsp;
In every offering presented to God, it is required, that we
should not &ldquo;give grudgingly or of necessity; for God loveth
a cheerful giver.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2 Cor. ix. 7.&nbsp; This is a
requisition more especially important, when the heart is the
gift, and God the receiver.&nbsp; Why should we hesitate or
grudge to give him <i>his own</i>?&nbsp; Instead, therefore, of
entertaining one repining thought at the idea, we should rather
rejoice that we have hearts to give the Lord, and that he is so
condescending as to take them at our hands.&nbsp; Mark with what
readiness and vivacity the sensualist and the pleasure-taker
devote their time and affections to pursuits of the most trifling
and sordid nature.&nbsp; These poor deluded idolizers of a
perishing world, think no time too long, and no pains too great,
though exhausted in a service <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>that is perfect bondage.&nbsp; They
want no arguments to enforce conformity to the world, neither is
the smallest compulsion necessary to drive them to their
pleasures.&nbsp; Self-gratification is a sufficient
inducement.&nbsp; Earthly things have an irresistible
attraction.&nbsp; The current of their affections carries them
away with an impetuous tide; and they glide swiftly and
cheerfully along, though the objects of their false felicity are
empty and precarious as the bubble, and the deceitful stream is
wafting them with a rapid but imperceptible course, to the gulf
of ruin.&nbsp; And shall these infatuated triflers be such
willing slaves of Satan, such cheerful devotees to folly? and we
engage in the service of the blessed Jesus, with reluctance or
reserve?&nbsp; Shall they give the world and its God their
<i>whole</i> hearts? and we <i>divide</i> ours with Him, who made
them and redeemed them?&nbsp; Shall they <i>fly</i>, when
dissipation solicits, and amusements call? and shall we
<i>creep</i>, when the God of love cries &ldquo;Follow
me?&rdquo;&nbsp; Forbid it gratitude, devotion, and common
sense!&nbsp; Rather may we say, &ldquo;Thine we are, Lord, by
ties the most sacred, and obligations the most binding, and thou
shalt have our whole hearts; for, thou art worthy!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And, in order to prevail on you to do this, give me leave to urge
those,</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>III.&nbsp; Motives, which ought to prompt our
compliance with the reasonable demand in the text.&nbsp; Now,
these are founded upon the state of the human heart by
nature&mdash;the many mercies we receive from God, the
uncertainty of time, and the great danger of
procrastination&mdash;and the nature of Him, who makes the
demand.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; If the heart were now in its primeval state of
rectitude and purity, the requisitions of its attachment and
obedience would be superfluous.&nbsp; But as it is very far gone
from original righteousness, and estranged from its great
original of blessedness and perfection; the effaced characters of
holiness and purity must be restored by the agency of the Holy
Ghost; and the foul stain of sin expunged by the blood of
Jesus.&nbsp; Hence, the scriptures so strongly insist upon the
necessity of &ldquo;a <i>new</i> heart and a right spirit,&rdquo;
Psal. li. because the natural heart is &ldquo;deceitful above all
things, and desperately wicked.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jer. xvii. 9.&nbsp;
And, as the same infallible authority declares, that
&ldquo;except a man be born again he cannot enter the kingdom of
heaven,&rdquo; John, iii. 3, see the important necessity of that
great change, and of the act of voluntary surrender, by which it
takes place.&nbsp; If you wish that obduracy, which steels them
both against <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>threatenings and promises, softened; and that
corruption, which makes your hearts naturally the sink of sin,
pardoned and subdued, you must give them to Jesus, for these
great purposes.&nbsp; Fancy not that any power of the creature is
sufficient to accomplish this.&nbsp; Sad experience may teach you
the contrary.&nbsp; Therefore, until your heart be given to God,
the fountain being evil, the streams must be so of course.&nbsp;
So that, all your thoughts, words, and actions, like the foul
exhalations that ascend from a stagnated and putrid lake, must
partake of the polluted source, from whence they rise, and be
infinitely odious in the sight of the Lord.&nbsp; And sooner
shall God cease to be, or his word fail in its accomplishment,
than any sinner, with an unchanged heart, shall enter his
kingdom.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Consider the mercies of God.&nbsp; How great! how
numerous! when traced from the moment of your birth, through the
successive stages of life to the present hour; or contemplated in
his glorious works, and most merciful dispensations!&nbsp; Divine
mercy hath spared the life, which divine power first gave, and a
long list of favors, as unmerited as they are numerous, hath
swelled the account through every interval of your days.&nbsp;
Fruitful seasons, exuberant plenty, outward peace, the possession
of health, the light of yonder sun that cheers the world with his
<a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>prolific
beam, and the clouds that drop fatness on the earth, vallies
standing thick with corn, and liberty, that crown of national
privileges, are all mercies, that have a voice, would sinners but
hear it, that cries, &ldquo;Oh that men would therefore praise
the Lord for his goodness, and declare the wonders that he doeth
for the children of men!&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. cvii. 8.&nbsp;
Reflect upon the mercies of redemption&mdash;upon the breadth,
length, depth, and height of them, as they shine out in richest
lustre in Jesus Christ; and say, Should you withhold your heart
from the Father of these mercies?&nbsp; Because he is merciful,
will you presume?&nbsp; And while he is dispensing his favors,
will you rebel against him?&nbsp; Had not mercy interposed, your
worthless heart had never been inquired after; and had God dealt
with you as your sins deserved, you might have been at this
moment beyond the reach of mercy for ever.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Know that another day may find you in eternity.&nbsp;
And if the great work should not be done, who would be in your
condition for ten thousand worlds?&nbsp; It is high time to awake
out of sleep.&nbsp; You have, perhaps, sometimes seen and
acknowledged the necessity of seeking the Lord.&nbsp; But, as if
this were a kind of bondage in which you were to engage, or some
grievous business you wished to postpone; you have been <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>putting it
off to some distant period, as if life were at your own disposal,
or religion the last thing a man should think of.&nbsp; Or, you
wished to give your heart to God; but a constant succession of
snares and rivals hath to this day prevented.&nbsp; Oh that you
may procrastinate and delay no longer!&nbsp; Lest, while you are
asking leave of the world and your lusts to give your heart to
God, death should strike the fatal blow, and transmit you to the
eternal world, to lament for ever your having trifled with your
immortal soul, your time, your conscience, and with God.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; I come now to urge the last motive, taken from the
nature of the person, who says, &ldquo;My son, give me thine
heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; That person is God; the most high, and holy
God; the Creator, Preserver, and Redeemer of men, who gave us a
being, and, when in a state of apostacy, took our nature, and was
manifest in the flesh, that he might save us from sin.&nbsp; The
three persons in the Godhead, Father, Son, and Spirit, unite in
the request; especially the second, who groaned beneath our
weight of woes, and sunk under the burden of our imputed guilt;
whose bitter passion bespoke the horrid nature of sin, and the
greatness of redeeming love.&nbsp; It is Jesus, the chiefest
among ten thousand, that asks your hearts, O sinners!&nbsp; They
are the purchase <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>of his blood; and can you deny him his own dear-bought
property?&nbsp; See him in his bloody sweat, or view him bleeding
and mangled on the cross, and then say, whether he must not have
loved your hearts, when Gethsemane&rsquo;s garden and
Calvary&rsquo;s mount have been witnesses to the intenseness of
his desire to win them?&nbsp; Fancy that you were present at the
tragical scene of his sufferings, and that you saw him this
moment nailed to the accursed tree; and that, while in this state
of ignominy and torture, you were accosted with the following
address from his precious dying lips:&mdash;&ldquo;Is it nothing
to you, all ye that pass by? behold and see, if there was ever
sorrow like unto my sorrow!&nbsp; Behold in my hands and feet the
marks of my dying love; and see, there gushes forth a fountain in
which the guilty may wash and be clean.&nbsp; While my temples
stream with blood, they are disgraced with a crown of thorns that
lacerate them, which I contentedly wear, that a diadem of glory
may encircle your brow.&nbsp; My heart is big with sorrow, and
upon my eye-lids is the shadow of death.&nbsp; My soul is
transfixed with the arrows of Almighty vengeance, the poison
whereof is the bitterest ingredient in my cup of sorrow.&nbsp;
For your sins I suffer all this, and die to save you from death
eternal.&nbsp; The last drop of my blood shall be shed to expiate
<a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>your
guilt, and the merit of it shall cleanse the earth, and perfume
heaven.&nbsp; My dying breath shall be spent in prayer for the
persons who brought me to this shame and pain; and I shall
rejoice in this travail of my soul, if you look to me for
salvation.&nbsp; I die to win your heart.&nbsp; Do not plant
additional daggers in mine, or tear open my wounds afresh by
denying my request.&nbsp; O, my son! give <span
class="GutSmall">ME</span> thine heart.&rdquo;&mdash;Thus may we
suppose the dying love of Jesus to address us.&nbsp; And who can
withstand such philanthropy, or withhold his heart from a
Redeemer, who asks it in agony and blood?&nbsp; A believer,
contemplating his crucified Lord in such circumstances of love
and sorrow, would say, with the poet,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O may I breathe no longer than I breathe<br
/>
My soul in praise to Him, who gave my soul,<br />
And all her infinite of prospect fair,<br />
Cut thro&rsquo; the shades of hell, Great Love, by thee!<br />
Oh! most adorable! most unador&rsquo;d!<br />
Where shall that praise begin, which ne&rsquo;er should
end?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now, brethren, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and
upon the authority of his sacred word, I beg leave to put the
grand question; which I pray that every one of us may be able to
answer in the affirmative, <span class="smcap">Have you given
your hearts to God</span>?&nbsp; I ask the question most
solemnly, as one that must shortly <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>meet you at the judgment-seat of
Christ; where if either preacher or hearers appear without the
blessing suggested in the text, it would be better we had never
been born.&nbsp; Remember, as you will answer at the great and
terrible day of the Lord, that I have this day begged you to give
Christ your hearts.&nbsp; If you do, he will wash them in his
blood; he will make them happy, and keep them so.&nbsp; But, if
the world engross your affections, and sin be suffered to
tyrannize in your heart, the consequence will be horrible beyond
all conception.&nbsp; Will you, therefore, <i>can</i> you,
<i>dare</i> you deny a request, that involves in it your eternal
happiness or misery?&nbsp; May there not be one dissentient
voice!&nbsp; But, with the most unanimous and solemn surrender,
may all cry out, &ldquo;Here are our hearts; blessed Jesus, take
them, and seal them eternally thine.&rdquo;&nbsp; Amen and
Amen.</p>

131</span>SERMON III.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">AN
INVITATION TO THE GOSPEL FEAST.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Come</i>; <i>for all things are now
ready</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Luke</span>, xiv.
17.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> parable, from whence I have
selected the text, resembles, in its general import, <i>that</i>
recorded in Mat. xxii. 2&ndash;10.&nbsp; The design of our Lord,
in both, is, to represent, under the similitude of a sumptuous
feast, the rich provision, which he hath made for his people in
the <i>covenant</i> of redemption;&mdash;the <i>suitableness</i>
of that provision to all the effects and consequences of our
fall;&mdash;the <i>medium</i> of its conveyance, the divine
person and glorious salvation of the Son of God;&mdash;the
extensive and merciful <i>invitation</i>, given in the gospel to
participate of its rich blessings;&mdash;and the different
<i>reception</i>, which that gospel meets with from the men of
the world; some treating it with indifference and scorn, and
others, through grace, embracing it <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>as the most acceptable message, that
ever addressed the ears of mortals, and as the most invaluable
gift, that God could bestow, or sinners receive.</p>
<p>These are the principal topics illustrated in both parables:
the analogy, beauty, and important tendency of which must strike
the mind of any person, whose eyes have been opened to see the
worth of his soul, and the method by which its guilt is to be
expiated and its pollutions cleansed; who is athirst for truth,
and longs to experience that happiness, which only they feel, who
know Christ and him crucified: by such an one, the blessings
exhibited in the parable will be considered as the most gracious
vouchsafement of Heaven; and the <i>call</i> given in the text,
as infinitely superior in importance, to that which would invite
the most indigent beggar to the table of plenty and munificence,
or raise a fettered captive from the <i>terrors</i> of a dungeon
to the splendor of a throne.</p>
<p>Though the parable, when delivered by our Lord, had a more
immediate reference to the state of the Jews; yet, as Providence
hath distinguished us by a similar greatness of religious
privileges; and to abuse and slight these favors is a
characteristic of our guilt, as it was of theirs; since, whatever
was written aforetime was written for our learning; and it is a
matter that involves <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>in it consequences of the most
serious nature, whether we receive or reject that greatest of all
the favors of Providence, the <span
class="GutSmall">GOSPEL</span> of the blessed God; I shall take
occasion to enforce the important invitation in the text, by
considering: I. The nature of the provision to which sinners are
invited: II. The extent and freeness of the invitation itself:
III. The grand argument to excite obedience to the invitation,
viz.&nbsp; &ldquo;All things are ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; As to the nature of the provision to which sinners
are invited, it is represented under the similitude of a
<i>feast</i>; prepared in the counsels of the Trinity before all
worlds, and exhibited in the fulness of time, when Messiah, the
bread of life, came down from heaven, and &ldquo;gave himself a
ransom for many.&rdquo;&nbsp; A feast, where all is of
God&rsquo;s providing; and in which, although the entertainment
cost an immense sum, and infinitely surpasseth all the delicacies
of nature, yet all is offered &ldquo;without money and without
price.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isa. lv. 1.&nbsp; A <i>great</i> feast,
because of the <i>dignity</i> of him who prepared it, the rich
<i>provision</i> made in it by the hand of munificent grace, and
the <i>multitudes</i> that in all ages have been fed from this
exhaustless store.&nbsp; It is called in the context a
<i>supper</i>; and the period in which the invitation was given
is called <i>supper-time</i>; perhaps in allusion to the period
of <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>our
Lord&rsquo;s incarnation, and of the promulgation of the gospel,
which happened in the eve of time, and is therefore styled by
prophets and apostles &ldquo;the last days,&rdquo; Acts, ii. 17.
Heb. i. 2, or last dispensation: not, that the blessings of
redemption were <i>confined</i> to that period, or commenced only
with the manifestation of Christ in the flesh.&nbsp; Abraham
rejoiced to see his day; and he saw it, and was glad.&nbsp; John,
viii. 56.&nbsp; And the gospel was preached to him, when Jehovah
said, &ldquo;In thee shall all nations of the earth be
blessed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gal. iii. 8.&nbsp; The promise made to our
first parents after the fall was a virtual exhibition of the
gospel feast; and the whole economy of Moses, with all its rites,
types, and oblations, but &ldquo;a shadow of good things to
come,&rdquo; of which Christ is the substance.&nbsp; Heb. x.
1.&nbsp; Israel in the wilderness &ldquo;ate the same spiritual
meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink.&nbsp; For, they
drank of that spiritual rock that followed them: and that rock
was Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Cor. x. 3, 4.&nbsp; The prophets were
raised up at different periods, to unfold the blessings contained
in the original promise to preach Christ, and predict his
&ldquo;sufferings and the glory that was to follow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
For, &ldquo;to him give all the prophets witness,&rdquo; Acts, x.
43: so that, from the beginning of time, in the family of Adam,
the days of the patriarchs, and <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>prophets, and the dispensation of
Moses, the same truth was revealed that afterwards shone forth
with superior lustre under the gospel dispensation; and believers
then feasted by faith on that Paschal Lamb, that was at last
actually offered up to take away the sin of the world.&nbsp; But
it was not till after a period of four thousand years had
elapsed, that the longings of the church of God were indulged
with that &ldquo;feast of fat things,&rdquo; Isa. xxv. 6, now
exhibited in the gospel.&nbsp; As there is but one sun to
illuminate both hemispheres, and his rays are sent forth in all
directions; so there is but one Sun of Righteousness to both
dispensations; and both are illuminated, though with different
degrees of irradiation; the light vouchsafed to the church before
the coming of Christ, resembling that of the &ldquo;morning
spread upon the mountains;&rdquo; the evangelical light, like the
sun in his meridian brightness.&nbsp; Yet, as the church is one,
so is the sun that illuminates her; and that sun is the Lord our
righteousness.</p>
<p>Some, guided in their interpretation of scripture, more by
sound than by sense, and by the analogy of faith, have supposed,
that the feast in the text, to which sinners are invited, is the
sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s supper; and they have added one
fatal mistake to another, by assuming from hence a false
authority of giving unlimited <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>and pressing invitations to sinners
to approach that sacred ordinance; as if, because, when the bread
and wine are prepared for the celebration of it, &ldquo;and all
things&rdquo; in <i>that</i> sense &ldquo;are ready,&rdquo;
therefore every man, who receives the invitation, ought to
&ldquo;come.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without enlarging here on the extreme
folly and danger of pressing men to come to the sacrament, before
they have by faith come to Christ; I cannot help observing, that
the scripture before us affords no room to justify their conduct,
or to countenance the absurd comment, on which the temerity of it
is founded.&nbsp; Not to say, that the parable looks back to a
period long <i>before</i> the sacrament was instituted, and that
the extensive invitation before us is absolutely incompatible
with the state of communicants in general; it is sufficient to
refute the interpretation imposed on the text only to observe,
that a parable cannot delineate an ordinance consisting of
outward symbols; since this would be to make one set of external
images and metaphors explanatory of another; and even to make the
latter, the <i>thing signified</i>, when it is itself <i>but a
sign</i>.&nbsp; The nature of a parable, and that of a sacrament,
may agree in delineating one subject common to both; but they
cannot mutually represent each other.&nbsp; Thus, the sacrament
of the Lord&rsquo;s supper is a feast, but it is only so as being
in its <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>elements a representation of the body and blood of
Christ.&nbsp; These are the &ldquo;inward part and thing
signified.&rdquo;&nbsp; But to those who receive the sign,
without acting faith on the thing signified, the sacrament
becomes no feast at all: they have no life or enjoyment in it;
and through their unbelief it turns eventually into poison
instead of food.&nbsp; So that what is the inward spiritual
substance of that institution, constitutes also the divine
realities couched under the metaphors in the parable.&nbsp; The
supper in both is, Jesus crucified for sinners, with all the
riches of his atonement and dying love; on which the soul of a
believer feeds, as its richest repast.</p>
<p>This reasoning is further strengthened by the consideration,
that in the corresponding parable in Mat. xxii. the <i>kingdom of
heaven</i> is said to be like unto a man making a great supper or
a wedding for his son.&nbsp; Now, the kingdom of heaven never
signifies a sacrament; but is used, when occurring in parables,
to represent the spiritual kingdom of the Messiah; or, the manner
in which he conducts the affairs of his church at large, with
respect to the dispensation of the gospel, and the influence of
his grace.&nbsp; And this observation leads us of course to
examine one most striking circumstance introduced by St. Matthew
into the correspondent <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>parable, as stated by <i>him</i>;
which is, that the feast was made upon occasion of &ldquo;a
<i>marriage</i> which a king made for his son.&rdquo; <a
name="citation138"></a><a href="#footnote138"
class="citation">[138]</a>&nbsp; The marriage is the union
between Christ and his church, which he espoused to himself from
all eternity in &ldquo;the counsel of peace which was
between&rdquo; the Father and him.&nbsp; Ephes. v. 32.&nbsp;
Zech. vi. 13.&nbsp; He agreed to be the church&rsquo;s
bridegroom; to take her into covenant relation, and into a most
sublime and intimate union with himself.&nbsp; He stipulated to
purchase her with his blood; and to transfer, as a dowry richer
than heaven and earth, the glorious righteousness which he was to
bring in by his life and death; together with all the personal
excellencies and divine perfections, which make him the chief
among ten thousand and altogether lovely.&nbsp; The day of his
nativity was the day of his espousals; and the hour of his death,
the important hour of her redemption.&nbsp; Each ransomed sinner
in his regeneration exemplifies this spiritual marriage; and
Christ does that actually in time, as fast as his redeemed are
called, which he did decretively before the foundation of the
world.&nbsp; And when all the purposes of his grace shall be
finished, <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>and &ldquo;the number of his elect accomplished,&rdquo;
then shall the grand and final solemnization of the nuptials
between the heavenly bridegroom and his church take place; and
heaven and earth shall sing, &ldquo;Let us be glad and rejoice:
for the marriage of the <span class="smcap">Lamb</span> is come,
and his <span class="smcap">Wife</span> hath made herself
ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rev. xix. 7.</p>
<p>It is, from hence, easy to perceive, that the high
entertainment provided for sinners, elected, redeemed,
regenerated, and united to Christ, is, the everlasting covenant,
ordered in all things and sure, of which he is the messenger and
the mediator; the conditions whereof were fulfilled by his
perfect obedience and meritorious death and passion; and all the
blessings comprehended in which, are as sure as the stipulation
of the glorious Trinity, the inviolable oath and promises of
Jehovah, and the redemption of Christ Jesus, could possibly make
them.&nbsp; This gracious covenant is the eternal charter of all
their privileges; and is, therefore, all their desire and all
their salvation.&nbsp; 2 Sam. xxiii. 5.&nbsp; They consider it as
incapable of being ever invalidated by the requisitions of law or
justice, the accusations of Satan, or the demerit of the foulest
iniquity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who shall lay any thing to the charge of
God&rsquo;s elect?&nbsp; It is <span class="smcap">God</span>
that justifieth: Who is he that condemneth?&nbsp; It is Christ
that died.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>Rom. viii. 33, 34.&nbsp; They behold
the contents of this mysterious volume unfolded in the person of
the Mediator&mdash;for, none in heaven or in earth was found
worthy so much as to look upon, much less to open, the book with
seven seals, but himself, Rev. v. 3,&mdash;and they see, with
rapture, its glorious ratification by his testamentary
death.&nbsp; Herein they read, not only their exemption from
guilt, but also their well-grounded title to everlasting glory,
through the imputed righteousness of God manifest in the
flesh.&nbsp; O what a rich feast is this covenant to him who
&ldquo;takes hold&rdquo; of it by faith, Isa. lvi. 4, to save him
from sinking in the gulf of perdition, and to secure his
everlasting salvation!&nbsp; With such a hold, he stands the
shock of earth and hell, maintains his ground amidst ten thousand
difficulties and dangers; sees his enemies all under his feet;
sings in the ways of the Lord, that great is the glory of the
Lord; and, &ldquo;although the fig-tree should not blossom, or
fruit be in the vines, the labor of the olive should fail, and
the fields should yield no meat, the flock should be cut off from
the fold, and there should be no herd in the stall: yet,&rdquo;
participating of such a banquet, and standing upon such a rock,
he &ldquo;rejoices in the Lord, and joys in the God of his
salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hab. iii. 17, 18.</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>The
covenant <i>agreed upon</i> between the persons of the Trinity,
is the feast <i>prepared</i>: the covenant revealed, is that
feast <i>exhibited</i>.&nbsp; But, O what a mysterious and
gracious exhibition!&nbsp; Behold it in the person, in the
obedience, and death, of the Prince of Peace! in that profound
mystery, &ldquo;God reconciling the world unto himself, by
bearing their sins in his own body on the tree,&rdquo; and
putting himself in our law-place, to endure the dreadful curse
and wrath of Jehovah!&nbsp; 2 Cor. v. 19. 1 Pet. ii. 24. Gal.
iii. 13.&nbsp; When the Jews asked, &ldquo;How can this man give
us his flesh to eat?&nbsp; Jesus answered, Except ye eat the
flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; John, vi. 52, 53.&nbsp; His flesh and blood are
the life, the feast, the salvation of sinners.&nbsp; The rending
of the one, and the effusion of the other, constituted that great
propitiation, by which sin is fully expiated, and inexorable
justice completely satisfied.&nbsp; Remission of sins, peace with
God, and peace in the conscience, all spring from this mysterious
source.&nbsp; When the eye of reason, blinded by unbelief, views
the Saviour in his humiliation, his poverty, his sorrows, his
death; it sees no form nor comeliness in him, to make him an
object of desire or attraction; pride abhors the sight, and
self-righteousness turns away with disgust.&nbsp; But in that man
of sorrows, covered with blood, <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>crowned with thorns, and nailed to
the accursed tree, the believer beholds the most glorious and
beauteous object in the whole universe of God; because he
considers and trusts in him as that great sacrifice, in the
offering up of which all the perfections of Deity shine forth in
the most stupendous exhibition.&nbsp; Faith beholds ten thousand
charms in a dying Christ, that captivate the heart, and fill it
with love and amazement.&nbsp; The beauty and glory of all
creation are eclipsed by the superior excellence of this bleeding
Prince of Peace.&nbsp; &ldquo;The chief among ten thousand, the
altogether lovely,&rdquo; are the favorite epithets, by which the
enraptured soul speaks its love and admiration of Jesus: and
&ldquo;<span class="GutSmall">WHAT SHALL I RENDER</span>?&rdquo;
is the astonished question it utters for a gift so great.&nbsp;
What faith sees, and admires, it feasts upon.&nbsp; The flesh of
Jesus is meat indeed, and his blood, drink indeed, John, vi. 55,
when that appropriating grace is in lively exercise.&nbsp; Hence,
every thing that belongs to the <i>crucified</i> Jesus, becomes a
feast, for food and delight, for strength and refreshment.&nbsp;
His blood and righteousness, his offices, and relations to his
people; his several titles that characterize his compassion, and
delineate his affection towards them; afford so many
inexhaustible themes for delightful meditation; by which the
souls of the weary are satiated, <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>and the conscience of the burdened
sinner calmed, and set at liberty.&nbsp; His agony and bloody
sweat, his cross and passion, are healing springs, from whence
ten thousand salutary streams of life, peace, and salvation,
flow.</p>
<blockquote><p>A wond&rsquo;rous feast his love prepares,<br />
Bought with his blood, his groans, and tears!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence, the <i>promises</i> are a feast, because they are all
sealed with his blood; and the <i>gospel</i> is a feast, because
it publishes a free and complete salvation through his
name;&mdash;that dear name, which, &ldquo;like ointment poured
forth,&rdquo; diffuses an exquisite fragrance throughout all the
promises, and communicates a preciousness to the gospel, which
makes it a rich savor of life unto life.&nbsp; And, when in that
sacrament, which, by sacred and significant symbols, exhibits his
dying love, the soul is enabled to eat the bread of life, and
drink that stream that gushes from the smitten <span
class="smcap">Rock</span>, 1 Cor. x. 4; it then joins issue with
the experience of the church in the Song of Solomon, &ldquo;He
brought me into the banqueting-house, and his banner over me was
love.&rdquo;&nbsp; Solomon&rsquo;s Song, ii. 4.</p>
<p>As the provision, which God hath been pleased to lay up in the
covenant of grace, and the redemption of his Son, is calculated
to communicate <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>entertainment infinitely more exalted and refined, than
what can be derived from the highest gratification of the senses;
it follows, that the feast we are considering, is of a
<i>spiritual</i> nature: it is a feast for the <i>soul</i>, that
nobler part of us, which constitutes our real selves, and in
which are lodged the quickest perceptions and most permanent
susceptibility of pleasure.&nbsp; For, as the soul, in the extent
of its desires, the capacious powers of its exertion, and the
resources of its enjoyments, surpasses, in so great a degree,
that earthly vehicle in which it dwells, and by an union with
which its immortal vigor is so much repressed and circumscribed;
so are the <i>pleasures</i> of the mind capable of being
proportionably more pure, more lasting, more refined, and more
sublime.&nbsp; But, as the senses are so intimately connected
with the rational faculties, and form those inlets by which
various pleasing sensations are conveyed to the soul; hence the
enjoyments of the latter are called, in scripture, by those very
terms which describe the exertions and distinguish the nature of
the former.&nbsp; Thus believers are said, &ldquo;to <i>taste</i>
and <i>see</i> that the Lord is good,&rdquo; Psal. xxxiv. 8; to
&ldquo;<i>handle</i> the word of life,&rdquo; 1 John, i. 1; to
&ldquo;<i>drink</i> the river of pleasures,&rdquo; Psal. xxvi. 8;
and to &ldquo;<i>eat</i> the bread of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
those objects in creation which strike the <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>senses with
the most exquisite delight, or are best calculated to convey
strength and nutriment to animal nature, are selected, by the
inspired writers, as symbols of those resources, from whence the
rich variety of a Christian&rsquo;s pleasures are derived.&nbsp;
The blessings of redemption are compared by the prophet to
<i>wine</i> and <i>milk</i>.&nbsp; Isa. lv. 1.&nbsp; This, the
most nutritive&mdash;that, the most exhilarating&mdash;liquid in
nature.&nbsp; The delicious droppings of the honey-comb were
inferior in sweetness, in the opinion of David, to the word of
God; and even &ldquo;the most fine gold&rdquo; had, in his
estimation, no value, when weighed in the balance with that
sacred treasure.&nbsp; What object in nature is so celebrated as
the <i>rose</i>, for its fragrance? the <i>lily</i> of the
vallies, for beauty? and the <i>sun</i>, for grandeur and
utility?&nbsp; Yet, the pleasure, which the senses imbibe from
the splendor of the one, or the perfumes of the other, is languid
and transient, compared with the superior satisfaction which the
enlightened soul feels, when contemplating the amiable
perfections of that Redeemer, who was white in immaculate
innocence as the lily; who, as the rose of Sharon, blushed in
blood; whose sacrifice sends up an odor before the throne of God,
that perfumes the heavens and the earth with the sweetest
incense; and who as the Sun of Righteousness, risen with healing
<a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>in his
wings, irradiates and cheers a world, naturally sunk in misery
and sin.</p>
<p>From hence it follows, that there is a divine reality in true
religion, of which the soul of a Christian is as sensible, as
when the eye beholds a beauteous object; the mouth tastes
delicious food; or the ear is charmed with harmonious
sounds.&nbsp; To dispute or deny this, would be to rob
Christianity of its essence, the gospel of its power, Christ of
his preciousness, and the soul of its heaven upon earth; and to
place the sordid gratifications of the epicure and the brute upon
a level with the enjoyments of a Christian living in happy
communion with his God, exulting in a sense of his favor, and
anticipating the prospect of everlasting felicity.&nbsp; But what
pleasure is comparable, then, with that of all the faculties of
the mind, engaged in intercourse with a reconciled God?&nbsp; The
<i>understanding</i> is feasted with views of the unsearchable
riches of Christ.&nbsp; The <i>will</i> is captivated with sweet
complacency in the plan of salvation through him.&nbsp; The
<i>affections</i> banquet on the sense of pardoning love.&nbsp;
And the <i>memory</i> is a repository of ten thousand sacred
sweets, collected from that bed of roses, the scriptures of
truth, and treasured up there, for the purpose of feeding and
regaling each spiritual sense.&nbsp; Thus is the <i>whole
soul</i> feasted.&nbsp; And this is the feast <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>of saints
on earth; and this, the banquet of the skies.</p>
<p>But, what endears the provision, and the God of all grace, who
made it, is; that it is a feast for <i>sinners</i>&mdash;for
sinners of the race of Adam&mdash;for the poor, the wretched, the
guilty, and the undone&mdash;for those, who have nothing to pay,
nothing to plead, and nothing to bring but misery and sin.&nbsp;
And this leads me to consider,</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The extent and freeness of the invitation
itself.</p>
<p>We are here carefully to distinguish the general invitation of
a preached gospel from the inward and effectual call of the Holy
Spirit: because, though in the salvation of individuals they
always co-operate, yet experience demonstrates, that, in
innumerable instances, the influences of the latter do not
necessarily and invariably attend the promulgation of the
former.&nbsp; If they did, what multitudes would be saved!&nbsp;
Yet, that sinners may be left without excuse for their obstinacy
and unbelief, the ministers of Christ are authorized to
&ldquo;preach the gospel to every creature;&rdquo; Mark, xvi. 15;
and to give a general call, to all that have ears to hear, to
come to the gospel feast.&nbsp; And, whatever some may argue to
the contrary, who affect to be &ldquo;wise above that which is
written,&rdquo; and who indulge themselves in a sort of
mischievous refinement <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>on the system of evangelical truth;
yet it is evident, as well from the blessings which have
particularly distinguished the ministrations of those, who give a
general call, as from the fact recorded in the parable, of
multitudes having been actually invited, who made light of the
invitation; that the ministers of Christ are warranted to
&ldquo;set life and death before all,&rdquo; and to beseech them
to &ldquo;choose life, that they may live;&rdquo; Deut. xxx. 15;
yea, to exhort even a Simon Magus to &ldquo;pray God, if haply
the sin of his heart may be forgiven,&rdquo; though previously in
&ldquo;the gall of bitterness and the bonds of
iniquity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Acts, viii. 22.&nbsp; Yet they know that
the power to &ldquo;choose life,&rdquo; to &ldquo;pray with the
spirit,&rdquo; and the blessing of forgiveness, are all of God;
that none can &ldquo;come to Christ except the Father <i>draw</i>
him;&rdquo; John, vi. 44; and that a putrid corpse in the grave
could as soon raise itself to life, or the &ldquo;dry
bones,&rdquo; Ezek. xxxvii. 1&ndash;4, in Ezekiel&rsquo;s vision,
form themselves, by their own power, into an army of living men,
as sinners &ldquo;dead in sin,&rdquo; Ephes. ii. 1, can, without
a divine agency, obey the invitation of the gospel.&nbsp; But,
knowing that to obey, and not to reason against the divine
command, is the duty of ministers; satisfied that secret things
belong unto the Lord, who reserves the knowledge of the human
heart, <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>and the distribution of his own favors, to himself; and
being persuaded that God can make the breath of life accompany
the breath of men, for the purpose of &ldquo;quickening <i>whom
he will</i>,&rdquo; John, v. 21, they, therefore, in imitation of
the prophet, who cried out, &ldquo;O ye dry bones, hear the word
of the Lord!&rdquo; say to sinners in general, &ldquo;Come; for
all things are now ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides, the gospel furnishes us with arguments so forcible,
and contains in itself motives so constraining, as to warrant and
encourage an address to all, as rational creatures.&nbsp; These
arguments and these motives are principally reducible to this
one, that &ldquo;God commendeth his love towards us, in that when
we were yet <span class="GutSmall">SINNERS</span>, Christ died
for us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. v. 8.&nbsp; And, as all are in that
predicament, it is upon a presupposition of that humiliating
truth, and the suitableness of a proportionate remedy, that I
proceed to urge the gospel invitation upon all present, and to
recommend the great provision of the covenant, because it
exhibits a feast for <i>sinners</i>.&nbsp; This is the leading
motive.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Had man retained his primeval innocence; to delight
himself in God as his supreme portion, and to feast the powers of
his soul in contemplating his glorious perfections; would have
been an employ as easy as it would have been pleasant.&nbsp; In
that case, the creatures would <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>have been considered as so many
streams leading up to one common fountain of goodness and
blessedness; while the wisdom, power, and benignity, which they
displayed, would have afforded to the mind an exhaustless fund of
love, and praise, and wonder, through everlasting ages.&nbsp; But
he sinned; and by sin was cut off from the fountain of his
happiness.&nbsp; The crown of honor fell from his head; and the
moral image of God, in which he had been created, was lost.&nbsp;
So that whatever delight he may have once experienced, in a
contemplation of the nature, works, and attributes of Deity; it
must have all ceased in the moment of his transgression.&nbsp; He
could not, in his fallen state, have derived any comfort from a
view of perfections, that bore the tremendous aspect towards him
as a rebel against his Maker.&nbsp; But here grace
interposed.&nbsp; The guilty fugitive is called back from his
apostacy, and invited to a scene, where he beholds all
Heaven&rsquo;s attributes receiving their respective claims, and
all harmonizing together for the purpose of his salvation.&nbsp;
Even stern <i>justice</i> itself advances to plead the
sinner&rsquo;s cause; and, in sweet concert with truth and mercy,
to shower blessings on his guilty head.&nbsp; It points to
Calvary; there shews its vindictive sword lying at the foot of
the cross, reeking with the blood of the slaughtered <span
class="smcap">Lamb</span>; and cries with <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>a loud
voice, &ldquo;Deliver him from going down to the pit; for I have
found a ransom.&rdquo;&nbsp; Job, xxxiii. 24.&nbsp; Thus justice
infinite, joins to spread the most delicious part of the gospel
repast; because it is written, &ldquo;God is just, and the
justifier of him who believeth in Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. iii.
26.&nbsp; And, though this part of the feast may be particularly
disgustful to the disciple of Sozo, <a name="citation151"></a><a
href="#footnote151" class="citation">[151]</a> who tramples under
foot the blood of the covenant, by denying its atoning virtue,
and the Deity of him who shed it; though it may be thought
unworthy the notice of the proud Sceptic, who employs his
philosophic wit to ridicule what he does not understand; or,
though the Pharisee should be so enamored with his dear idol,
Self, as to fly from a truth that aims at pulling the dagon of
self-righteousness down to the ground; yet to one, who hath
<i>felt</i> himself a sinner, and hath been made to <i>dread</i>
the requisitions of God&rsquo;s justice as a bar to preclude the
claims of mercy, no saying will appear so worthy of acceptation,
as that &ldquo;Christ Jesus came into the world to save the chief
of sinners,&rdquo; and that God is both &ldquo;faithful and
<i>just</i>,&rdquo; when he extends forgiveness through his
Son.&nbsp; 1 Tim. i. 15. 1 John, i. 9.</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>2.&nbsp; The condition of the persons, for whom the
gospel feast is prepared, affords another most powerful motive to
encourage our approach to it.&nbsp; The messengers in the parable
were commanded to invite &ldquo;the poor, the maimed, the halt,
and the blind.&rdquo;&nbsp; Persons labouring under bodily
infirmities, here represent poor sinners oppressed with spiritual
maladies, and waiting, like the paralytic at Bethesda&rsquo;s
pool, for a cure.&nbsp; Such crowd about the door of mercy; and
only such will bless the hand of the great Physician.&nbsp; The
call is general: but, to none will it be particular, or welcome,
or effectual, but to those who <i>see</i> their wants, and
<i>feel</i> their sins.&nbsp; The message of the gospel is manna
itself for sweetness, to such as have received the sentence of
death in themselves by the law.&nbsp; But the &ldquo;<i>full</i>
soul loatheth <i>this</i> honey-comb.&rdquo;&nbsp; Prov. xxvii.
7.&nbsp; It would be deemed an insult, to spread a feast for the
full; to recommend a physician, or propose a remedy to persons in
health; to offer water to him that is not thirsty, or a garment
to him who is already clothed; to preach liberty to him who is
not bound, or to point him to a fountain who is clean in his own
eyes.&nbsp; But, though the &ldquo;whole have no need of a
physician, but they that are sick,&rdquo; Mat. ix. 12, to such as
see themselves foul and leprous, lost, and guilty, the <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>streams of
Jordan were not more efficacious to eradicate Naaman&rsquo;s
leprosy, than the fountain of Christ&rsquo;s blood is to cleanse
from sins of the deepest dye.&nbsp; Say not then, &ldquo;I am
unworthy; my sins are too enormous to be forgiven; my spiritual
maladies of too long standing, and too inveterate, to be cured;
and my heart of too stubborn a mould, to be softened or
vanquished.&rdquo;&nbsp; If all the enormities of Manasseh, the
blasphemings and persecutions of Saul, the backslidings of David
and Peter, and all the guilt of Magdalen, met in thy single
person, so as to make thee a monster in iniquity; yet, all this
accumulated transgression would be no more to the infinite merit
of the Redeemer&rsquo;s blood, than the smallest cloud to the
sun&rsquo;s meridian brightness, or the debt of one single mite
to the treasure of an empire; than a drop to the ocean, or a
grain of sand to the globe.&nbsp; &ldquo;The blood of Jesus
cleanseth from <span class="GutSmall">ALL</span>
sin.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 John, i. 7.&nbsp; No patient ever failed
under the care of that great Physician: no indigent beggar was
ever spurned from his door: no heart ever remained unsoftened
under the influence of his grace: no sinner ever perished at the
foot of his cross.&nbsp; If you are weary and heavy laden, Jesus
saith, &ldquo;Come unto ME, and I will give you
rest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mat. xi. 28.&nbsp; If your heart be hard and
unbelieving, he saith again, &ldquo;My son give <i>me</i> thine
<a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Prov. xxiii. 26.&nbsp; If your
transgressions are numerous and aggravated, he saith again,
&ldquo;Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as
snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as
wool.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isa. i. 18.&nbsp; If all the rebellion of the
prodigal centres in thy conduct, and thou, nevertheless, art
desirous of returning to thy God; see, as in his case, the Father
of mercies runs to meet thee, he opens his arms to embrace thee,
his house to receive thee, his wardrobe to clothe thee, his heart
to love and pity thee, and he spreads his table with the richest
dainties wherewith to feed thy famished soul.&nbsp; And if thou
still persist to think thy case even worse than his, and unbelief
could furnish thee with ten thousand arguments to keep thee from
coming to Christ, the following glorious promise is sufficient to
overturn them all: &ldquo;Him that cometh to me, I will in <i>no
wise</i> cast out.&rdquo;&nbsp; John, vi. 37.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But, the last, and by no means the least motive, that
I shall mention under this head, as an inducement to warrant and
encourage the self-diffident and returning sinner to partake of
the blessings of the gospel, is, that they are all the free gift
of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.&nbsp; Rom. vi. 23.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ho! every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and
he that hath no money, let him come.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isa. lv.
1.&nbsp; Indeed a moment&rsquo;s serious <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>reflection
on the nature of the favors requisite to a sinner&rsquo;s
salvation, such as, an interest in the covenant, peace with
Heaven, pardon of sin, justification before God, the spirit of
holiness, and eternal life; or on the greatness of the price,
with which they have been purchased, even &ldquo;the blood of
God;&rdquo; Acts, xx. 28; or on the demerit of those, who are the
recipients of those immense favors;&mdash;might convince any one
of the folly and presumption of expecting the very least, on the
ground of personal worthiness; and yet encourage the hope and
banish the fears of the weakest and most depressed sinner upon
earth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think not&rdquo; then, as the apostle said to
Simon the sorcerer, &ldquo;that the gift of God may be purchased
with money&rdquo;&mdash;with human merit.&nbsp; Acts, viii.
20.&nbsp; Were you a possessor of all the treasures of the earth,
or of all the moral excellencies that ever centred in any natural
man since the fall, you would not therefore be entitled to even
the crumbs that fall from God&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; Yet the
deepest poverty, the greatest unworthiness, are no bars to
preclude your receiving the choicest of his favors, even eternal
life.&nbsp; As, therefore, you <i>have</i> nothing to pay off the
immense debt you owe, so nothing is required; no merit, no works,
no recommendation whatever.&nbsp; All is purchased already; and
all gratuitously tendered.&nbsp; Nothing remains for <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>the sinner,
convinced of his lost condition, but to receive with an empty
hand and humble heart what infinite beneficence freely
offers.&nbsp; Mercy&rsquo;s door is open.&nbsp; The ministers of
Christ invite you in.&nbsp; The master of the feast bids you
welcome, saying, &ldquo;Eat, O friends, drink; yea, drink
abundantly, O beloved.&rdquo;&nbsp; Solomon&rsquo;s Song, v.
1.&nbsp; The table is spread with ten thousand rich and costly
benefits.&nbsp; The banquet is a feast of love; and &ldquo;the
spirit and the bride say, <i>Come</i>, and let him that heareth,
say, <i>Come</i>, and let him that is athirst, <i>Come</i>, and
whosoever will, let him take the water of life
freely.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rev. xxii. 17.&mdash;But this leads me to
urge,</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; The grand argument mentioned in the text to excite
obedience to the invitation, viz. &ldquo;All things are
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This head of the discourse will contain little more than a
recapitulation of the principal subjects already considered; and
they might, indeed, on that account, be thought
superfluous.&nbsp; But, as upon occasion of a sumptuous
entertainment, it would engage the attendance of a guest more, to
see presented all together the several delicacies to which he is
invited, than to hear a logical discussion about their various
qualities; I shall, therefore, now bring together in one view,
all that a God of rich grace and profuse munificence hath
exhibited in the gospel feast; <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>praying, if it be his blessed will,
that all who hear the invitation this day may have grace to
accept it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All things are ready.&rdquo;&mdash;The great
<i>deed</i> is ready, that recites the covenant stipulations
between the Father and the Son, and records the names of all the
ransomed of the Lord; signed by infinite truth, and sealed with
blood.&nbsp; Psal. xl. 6&ndash;9.&nbsp; Heb. x. 5&ndash;9.</p>
<p>The great <i>sacrifice</i> is ready; on which the fire of
vindictive justice fell, in the day of our Lord&rsquo;s
crucifixion; prefigured by the beasts that bled for a long
succession of ages on Jewish altars; typified in Isaac, but
realized in that propitiatory victim, the crucified Jesus.&nbsp;
Heb. x. 1,12.</p>
<p>A <i>pardon</i> is ready; procured for infinite offence; for
crimes of the deepest dye; for sinners of the most flagrant
complexion; and which speaks its value infinite, bought with the
blood of God incarnate.&nbsp; Ephes. i. 7.&nbsp; Acts, xx.
28.</p>
<p>A <i>righteousness</i> is ready; wrought out by the obedience
and death of Messiah; the imputation of which covers guilt,
screens from the curse of the law; fulfils its precepts, and
satisfies justice; a righteousness, which &ldquo;justifieth from
<span class="GutSmall">ALL</span> things, and is <i>unto</i>
all&rdquo; as a free gift, &ldquo;and&rdquo; as a spotless robe
&ldquo;<i>upon</i> all them that <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>believe.&rdquo;&nbsp; Acts, xiii.
39.&nbsp; Rom. iii. 20.&nbsp; This is the wedding-garment.&nbsp;
Mat. xxii. 11.</p>
<p>A <i>fountain</i> is ready; that gushes from the
Saviour&rsquo;s side, with a mingled stream of water and blood;
to wash away the guilt and filth of sin; of efficacy to purify
from all uncleanness; where thousands have bathed their leprous
souls, and in which thousands more may wash and be clean as an
angel of light.&nbsp; Zech. xiii. 1.</p>
<p>A <i>provision</i> is ready; rich in inexhaustible supplies of
<i>strength</i> for the weak, of <i>wisdom</i> for the ignorant,
of <i>medicine</i> for the diseased, of <i>consolation</i> for
them that mourn, of <i>bread</i> of life for the hungry, of
<i>water</i> from a never-failing spring for the <i>thirsty</i>;
and all in Christ, free for his people as the air they breathe,
and deep in boundless fulness as the ocean.&nbsp; John, i.
16.</p>
<p>The <i>Spirit of holiness</i> is ready; to change the desert
of the human heart into an Eden, and to make springs of grace
arise, where streams of bitterness and pollution flowed before;
to take of the things of Christ, and shew them in all their
riches to the poor and contrite; to form the new creation, and
take away the heart of stone.&nbsp; Isa. xxxv. 1.&nbsp; Ezek.
xxxvi. 26.</p>
<p>The <i>promises</i> are ready; to attest the truth of God; to
seal the salvation of Christ; to give encouragement to the weary
and heavy laden <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>to cast their burdens on him; and to delineate his
all-sufficiency: in him they meet: in him they are all yea and
amen: from him they derive their preciousness, and every one of
them is as unchangeable as the God that spoke them. 2 Pet. i.
4.&nbsp; Mat. v. 18.</p>
<p>The <i>Father</i> of mercies is ready; to receive the
returning prodigal, to blot out his rebellions, and love him
freely.&nbsp; The <i>Son</i> is ready; to plead the purchase of
his blood, and carry the sheep that was lost into the fold of his
flock.</p>
<p>The <i>ministers of the gospel are</i> ready; to preach
deliverance to the captives, and the opening of the prison to
them that are bound; to instruct the ignorant, and guide their
feet into the way of peace; and to rejoice in seeing the fruit of
the travail of Christ&rsquo;s soul in the salvation of
sinners.</p>
<p><i>Angels</i> are ready; to take up their harps of gold, and
tune them to notes of the sweetest harmony; to make the heaven
and the heaven of heavens resound with praises to Emmanuel, and
with joy over one sinner that repenteth.&nbsp; Oh! that they may
repeat that anthem to-day, which they have had occasion to sing,
whenever souls have been brought home to Christ!&nbsp; These
blessed spirits watch with eagerness the effects of the
gospel-message; and when any <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>one sinner obeys it, they fly with
the good news to the realms of light, and diffuse fresh joy
through all the spirits that surround the throne.&nbsp; But if
angels could weep, surely they would drop a tear, with sorrow and
surprise, to see sinners spurn a feast, which their Creator
prepared, and to which they themselves would have been proud of
an invitation.</p>
<p>Come, then, ye that dread the wrath of God, and wish to escape
from those sins that have exposed you to it; ye, who are
oppressed with their intolerable load, and can find no relief
from all the expedients you have hitherto adopted; O come to this
sacred feast of redeeming love!&nbsp; Multitudes, whose case was
worse than yours, have been admitted to it; have found the
blessings they stood in need of, and are now feasting around the
throne of God and of the Lamb.&nbsp; They, like you, were afraid
to come; and their unworthiness, which should have driven to
Christ, kept them, for a long time, from him; till, having at
last seen all resources fail, every creature a broken cistern,
and all their works and duties but miserable comforters and
physicians of no value; they were obliged to go with all their
complaints, and wants, and wounds, to him, who is the
sinner&rsquo;s forlorn hope; and in Jesus they met with a
physician and a friend: He bound up their wounds, <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>supplied
their wants, removed their burdens, spoke peace to their
consciences, and shewed them all the riches of his grace and
righteousness to comfort and support.&nbsp; One look by faith to
his bleeding sacrifice, dispelled the gloom that covered their
desponding minds, and filled them with hope, and joy, and
peace.&nbsp; They only wonder now, that they should have so long
doubted of his sufficiency and love; and, if any thing
<i>could</i> interrupt for a moment the bliss of saints above, it
would give them pain, even in heaven, to reflect, that they
should have ever entertained a suspicion of Christ&rsquo;s
ability and willingness to save; or have hesitated to come to the
gospel feast when God himself invited.&nbsp; But their doubts are
now for ever done away; and it magnifies the riches of sovereign
grace, that Jesus conquered and pardoned the unbelief, that gave
the lie to his promises, and depreciated the great remedy of his
atonement.&nbsp; Yet, having &ldquo;come out of great
tribulation, and washed their robes, and made them white in the
blood of the Lamb,&rdquo; &ldquo;they hunger no more, neither
thirst any more: but the Lamb, which is in the midst of the
throne, doth feed them, and lead them to fountains of living
waters; and God hath wiped away all tears from their
eyes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rev. vii. 14, 16, 17.</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>As
the feast recommended in the text is of a sacred nature, it can
of course afford no entertainment, and give no encouragement, to
those presumptuous professors, who dare &ldquo;to sin because
grace abounds;&rdquo; who take occasion, from the sumptuousness
of the gospel feast, and the benignity of its Founder, to quote
his very favors in justification of the most abominable
licentiousness of manners; and sit down to his table only to
insult him for the liberality that spread it.&nbsp; <i>Grace</i>,
it is true, and grace alone, presides throughout with unrivalled
glory, in contriving, accomplishing, and applying the great plan
of salvation through the Redeemer.&nbsp; And though that grace
confers all its favors gratuitously, and strongly presupposes the
guilt and unworthiness of the recipients of them; yet as personal
holiness is one of the favors it communicates, and makes a
considerable branch of the evidences of a sinner&rsquo;s
salvation; they who leave it out in their pretended systems of
evangelical truth, or disregard it in their walk and
conversation, are convicted by the very fact of fatal error on
the one hand, as well as of practical impiety on the other.&nbsp;
For &ldquo;the grace of God that bringeth salvation, teacheth us,
that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
righteously, soberly, and godly, in this present
world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tit ii. 12.&nbsp; Whoever <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>sits down
to the banquet of redeeming love, is supposed to rise up with a
heart overflowing with gratitude to Jesus for the blessings
imparted to him, and to go away more wise, more happy, and more
holy.&nbsp; To act differently, would be to imitate the outrage
of a victorious army rioting on the spoils of the vanquished, and
intoxicating themselves with the fruits of their
Commander&rsquo;s conquests.&nbsp; Christ hath conquered for us;
and the gospel feast is the consequence of his glorious victory
over sin and hell.&nbsp; Believers conquer and feast with
him.&nbsp; But their triumph ought to be sober, and their mode of
rejoicing suited to the dangers they have escaped, and the sacred
service in which they are engaged.&nbsp; But they who make
Christ, either in their systems or their practice, &ldquo;the
minister of sin,&rdquo; bear his name in vain, or expose it to
reproach in the face of the world.&nbsp; The gospel, therefore,
spreads no feast for the Antinomian; and, where it is abused, the
food which it exhibits is turned into poison, and proves a savor
of death unto death.&nbsp; &ldquo;Without holiness no man shall
see the Lord.&nbsp; And let every one that nameth the name of
Christ depart from iniquity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ye devotees of pleasure, ye lovers of the world, ye egregious
triflers with your immortal interests; ye, who, though hastening
to your <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>graves, are still sporting on destruction&rsquo;s
brink, and indulge a false and fatal levity, though the precipice
is before you, and one single step would determine your doom for
ever; ye, who have been pursuing phantoms, and grasping at
shadows, while you suck happiness in a world lying in wickedness,
and, amidst all your cares and schemes for this world, forget
that you are to die, neglect your souls, and never take one
solemn anxious thought about eternity; to you also I bring the
invitation in my text: &ldquo;Come; for, all things are
ready.&rdquo;&nbsp; I invite you this day, in the name of my
great Lord and Master, to Christ, to happiness, to heaven.&nbsp;
Ye have been long toiling for that which is not bread, and
spending your strength for what can yield little satisfaction in
life, and none at all in the hour of death.&nbsp; Still time
flies with its wonted velocity; and the king of terrors is
drawing from his quiver the arrow, that shall ere long lay you in
the dust.&nbsp; Satan, the world and sin, strongly unite to keep
you in their servitude; and spread ten thousand baits to allure
you to destruction.&nbsp; But shall their call be obeyed? and
God&rsquo;s invitation disregarded?&nbsp; Shall hell be preferred
to heaven? the care of your bodies to that of your souls?&nbsp;
Shall time engross all your solicitude, and eternity, dread
eternity, none?&nbsp; Shall the adversary of God and man call <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>with a more
attractive voice, than he who bled for sinners? and the biting
pleasures of sensuality, be preferred before the joys that are at
God&rsquo;s right hand?&nbsp; God forbid!&nbsp; O sirs, pause a
moment!&nbsp; Consider what you are, whither you are going.&nbsp;
Your souls are at stake, and you must soon stand before the
living God in judgment.&nbsp; Obey the call of the gospel; and
all shall yet be well: disobey it; and the call itself shall be
more than a thousand witnesses against you: and he who gives it
will be clear of your blood.&nbsp; But, embrace the invitation;
and my soul shall rejoice over you, even mine; and you shall
rejoice with joy unspeakable, when the Judge comes in the clouds
of heaven, and time shall be no more.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">THE
CONTRAST.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>For the wages of sin is death</i>,
<i>but the gift of God is eternal life</i>, <i>through Jesus
Christ our Lord</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Romans</span>,
vi. 23.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> appears, at first view, rather
extraordinary, that there should be any opponents of the doctrine
of original sin; since, not to say, that it has a voucher for its
existence in the heart of every individual son of Adam, and is
corroborated by the testimony of melancholy matter of fact; upon
the acknowledgment of this doctrine depends every truth of
revelation; and more especially that, which relates to the
redemption of sinners by the obedience and sufferings of the Son
of God.&nbsp; Indeed, the entire system of the gospel stands or
falls with it.&nbsp; The truth of man&rsquo;s apostacy from
original righteousness forms a grand and necessary link in <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>the golden
chain of evangelical doctrines.&nbsp; Take <i>that</i> away, and
the coherence between the rest is broken of course; and, by the
fatal disruption, the fairest hopes of a sinner are torn up by
the root, and all his bright prospects into eternity clouded and
obscured.&nbsp; For, it is upon a pre-supposition of man&rsquo;s
depravity, helplessness, and guilt, that a propitiatory sacrifice
hath been offered up, and a foundation for peace and pardon laid
in the cross of Jesus; that a remedy hath been offered,
proportionate to the depth of our malady, and a proclamation of
mercy issued out, from the throne of God.&nbsp; Blot out these
inestimable benefits, then, and what is man?&mdash;an inheritor
of sorrow and sin, borne rapidly along by time&rsquo;s impetuous
tide, and, like a ship without a rudder or sails, at the mercy of
every storm; liable to be shipwrecked in death, and to sustain an
irreparable, an eternal loss; without one cheerful beam of hope
to guide him through the gloom of adverse dispensations, or to
light his footsteps in the valley of the shadow of death.</p>
<p>A denial of the fall is an absurd effort to dispute a fact the
most incontrovertible, to subvert the foundations of
Christianity, to bereave sinners of their choicest hope, and
virtually to supersede one of the most necessary, and most
glorious works of God.&nbsp; For, what is redemption, <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>if we are
not &ldquo;by nature the children of wrath?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ephes.
ii. 3.&nbsp; Would it not, in that case, be an unmeaning and
superfluous undertaking?&nbsp; Why did the co-equal Son of the
Most High leave the bosom of his Father, to pay a ransom of
infinite value, if there were no captives to be redeemed?&nbsp;
Or why did he, in unparalleled mercy, quit his throne &ldquo;to
seek and save those that were lost,&rdquo; if mankind were not in
that unhappy predicament?&nbsp; What is it that places the love
of God, and the philanthropy of the Friend of sinners, in the
most captivating and admirable point of view?&nbsp; It is the
helpless and guilty condition of the race of man.&nbsp; This is
the foil, that sets off redemption to infinite advantage, and
that reflects such unrivalled honor on the gracious Author of
it.&nbsp; But deny the fall, and redemption shines no more; and
all the glory of him, who contrived and executed the plan, is
destroyed at once.&nbsp; Whereas admit that humiliating fact, and
you hear all the harps of heaven tuned to the praises of Jesus,
and see him adorned with the crown of salvation; while men and
angels join their loudest and most grateful tribute of
thanksgiving to that condescending Saviour of sinners.&nbsp; The
most variegated and lively teints that form the rainbow, are
painted by the reflection of the sun&rsquo;s rays on the body of
the darkest cloud.&nbsp; So, it is on the <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>gloom of
our apostate nature that the rays of the Sun of Righteousness are
reflected with the most conspicuous lustre; and it is even by
that dark medium that all the perfections and attributes of Deity
shine out with the greatest harmony, and the most wonderful
irradiation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The wages of sin is death, but the gift
of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The text exhibits a surprising contrast; and the design of my
improvement upon it, is to consider separately, and oppose to
each other, the constituent parts of that contrast; to the end
that we may enjoy an opportunity of seeing, how low human nature
hath been sunk by sin, and to what a height of exaltation it hath
been raised by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The one
view will help to inspire gratitude into the breast of a saved
sinner; the other will give him cause for self-humiliation, and
afford him an inexhaustible topic for praise and wonder, through
everlasting ages.&nbsp; This contrasted representation, like a
happy mixture of light and shade in a well-executed piece of
painting, will place the great doctrines I am to insist upon, in
such an advantageous point of view, as to display the
consistency, connexion, wisdom, and beauty, of the whole.&nbsp;
From whence we shall see, of course, that, though the text
presents a dark side, in which the principal and <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>awful
figures in the back ground are &ldquo;sin and death;&rdquo; yet,
like the pillar of a cloud and fire that followed the camp of
Israel, it has a bright side too, sufficiently luminous to guide
the Christian pilgrim through the wilderness of this world, and
to light him to glory, with safety and triumph.</p>
<p>The first thing to be considered is, that &ldquo;the wages of
sin is death.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, as death is an event so
humiliating and so formidable, let us attend a little to the
nature of that great evil that produces it.&mdash;According to
the definition given by an inspired apostle, &ldquo;sin is the
transgression of the law&rdquo;&mdash;of that moral law, or rule
of rectitude, which had been originally written on the heart of
man, and which, when the characters of it were obliterated there,
by the first act of disobedience, was afterwards inscribed on two
tables of stone.&nbsp; A circumstance that wisely suggested the
propriety of placing the decalogue in the most conspicuous part
of our churches; to the end, that whenever we cast our eyes on
these two sacred tables, and reflect on the sanctions and purity
of their precepts, we might see our transgressions, and implore
that mercy which God hath revealed through that Saviour, who is
the &ldquo;end of the law for righteousness to every one that
believeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; The law is &ldquo;holy&rdquo; in its
precepts, &ldquo;just&rdquo; in its requisitions, and
&ldquo;good&rdquo; <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>in the end, for which it was originally given.&nbsp; It
delineates, as it were, and transcribes the moral image of the
Deity.&nbsp; And such is the rigor and extensiveness of its
demands, that it not only condemns every the least deviation from
the letter of its commandments, but it also takes cognizance of
the thoughts of the heart, as well, as the actions of the
life.&nbsp; &ldquo;The law is spiritual.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. vii.
14.&nbsp; And its spirituality extends to the most latent
recesses of the mind.&nbsp; Its penetrating light breaks in upon
the desires and inclinations of the heart, in their darkest
retreat, and condemns sin in embryo, as well as when it &ldquo;is
brought forth&rdquo; into actual commission.&nbsp; Having
originated in the wisdom of the supreme Legislator, and having
been appointed as a rule of life and a test of obedience, to
protect the interests of the divine government in the world, it
stands as unchangeably pure in its nature, and as unalterable in
its requirements, as the God, who gave it, is in his own
immutable essence.</p>
<p>Behold sin, then, in this pure mirror.&nbsp; How is its
deformity exposed, and its malignity enhanced by the purity of
that law of which it is the transgression!&nbsp; Every sin, in a
greater or less degree, aims at destroying the very existence of
the divine law; and at subverting the dominion which Jehovah
claims as his own indisputable <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>prerogative amongst his own
creatures.&nbsp; Sin implies an effort to set up another in
direct opposition to the supremacy of Heaven.&nbsp; It is a
direct and gross insult upon the Majesty of God.&nbsp; It pours
contempt on his legislative authority to make laws, and virtually
impeaches his wisdom and justice in requiring obedience to
them.&nbsp; Sin is rebellion against the Most High; and its
dreadful concomitants are anarchy and confusion.&nbsp; In its
hideous deformity, it bears the impress of hell; and, like that
malign spirit that attempted to usurp the sovereignty of the
skies, it carries the features of that black apostacy, that would
have pushed from his throne the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p>Such is the nature of sin.&nbsp; But trace it, in its origin,
its consequences, and its effects, and you will perceive its
aggravations swell in every view.&nbsp; See its fatal effects
even in heaven itself.&nbsp; What disorder did it occasion among
the armies of the skies!&nbsp; When, after having lifted up an
innumerable company of angels with proud rebellion against the
throne of God, it plunged them, with Lucifer at their head, from
the summit of bliss and honor, down to the inextinguishable
flames and bottomless abyss of tophet.&nbsp; Or, go to Eden, and
mark there the sad catastrophe of our fall.&nbsp; See our first
parents arrested by the hand of justice, and, like <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>a pair of
criminals, compeers in guilt and partners in woe, turned out of
that delectable spot, where all the rich spontaneous gifts of
nature concurred with the light of God&rsquo;s countenance, to
make it a representation, in miniature, of the celestial
paradise.&nbsp; See the angry cherub brandishing his flaming
sword, placed as a vengeful guardian of the tree of life.&nbsp;
Behold shame, sorrow, disease, and death, the melancholy
attendants on the unhappy culprits! the earth under their feet,
cursed with briers and thorns! and elements around them, armed
with the thunder of their Creator&rsquo;s frown!&nbsp; Ask, what
is the cause of this sad reverse of their former state of rest,
peace, and fertility?&nbsp; The answer is, this hath sin
done.</p>
<p>Consult the history of mankind since the fall, especially
those faithful records given us in the inspired writings, and you
will see one continued chain of successive dispensations, loudly
declarative of the evil of sin.&nbsp; Why were the windows of
heaven opened, and the fountains of the great deep broken up, to
form that immense inundation of waters, that covered every part
of the globe, and topped its highest hills; and, the little
family in the ark only excepted, swept away all the inhabitants
of the earth at a stroke?&nbsp; It was because &ldquo;God saw,
that the <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span><i>wickedness</i> of man was great in the earth, and
that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
continually.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gen. vi. 5.&nbsp; Why was Sodom
consumed by fire from heaven, and that sink of sin converted into
a lake of the most putrid and pestilential quality?&nbsp; Why did
the earth open, and swallow up Korah and his company? or a
succession of plagues depopulate and deluge with blood the Land
of Egypt?&nbsp; How came Israel to fall by thousands in the
wilderness? and in great numbers to be carried away into an
enemy&rsquo;s country, and to wear the galling yoke of long,
grievous, and reiterated captivities?&nbsp; What was the cause of
their final dispersion?&nbsp; It was <span
class="GutSmall">SIN</span> that lay at the root of all these
visitations.&nbsp; And the same evil that laid Babylon or
Jerusalem in ashes, and annihilated the proudest empires of
Greece and Rome, is to this day proclaiming its existence in the
judgments that are abroad in the earth.&nbsp; If the pestilence
walketh in darkness, or sickness destroyeth at noon-day; if war
rages, or famine stalks through the land; if earthquakes make
whole continents tremble, and spread devastation and death; it is
<span class="GutSmall">SIN</span>, that hath awakened these awful
visitants of incensed justice, which will, all at once, be let
loose upon a guilty world, in the great and terrible day of the
Lord, to complete <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>its ruin, and give one final demonstration of the
malignity of sin, by the conflagration of heaven and earth.</p>
<p>We have visited the Garden of Eden, to view there the
melancholy origin and fatal effects of sin.&nbsp; Let us now go
to another garden, where we shall see this great evil still more
conspicuously displayed.&nbsp; I mean the garden of
Gethsemane.&nbsp; Behold! <i>who</i> lies there prostrate on the
ground! drowned in tears! and bathed in blood!&nbsp; What means
that agony, which tortures his immaculate soul, and makes him
&ldquo;sorrowful even unto death?&rdquo;&nbsp; What was the heavy
load under which an angel is despatched from heaven to support
him?&nbsp; Hark! how he entreats his Father, that, if possible,
&ldquo;the bitter cup might pass from him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Follow
him to Calvary.&nbsp; See him fainting under the load of his
cross, as he ascends the hill.&nbsp; Now begins the tragical
scene.&nbsp; Behold him extended on the accursed tree!&nbsp; Why,
thou blessed Jesus, wert thou brought so low, and covered with
such foul ignominy?&nbsp; Why didst thou suffer thy sacred head
to be crowned, and lacerated with thorns? and thy hand to be
disgraced with a symbol of mock royalty, when it might have been
extended to the destruction of thine enemies?&nbsp; Was thy
death, with all the circumstances of horror and shame that
attended it, the just wages of any personal iniquity?&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>Thy nature was immaculate, and thy life
unblemished.&nbsp; But it was sin imputed, that constituted the
bitter ingredient in thy cup of sorrow; and our guilt
transferred, that brought thee down to the chamber of
death.&nbsp; They were our transgressions that pointed the
thorns, and sharpened the nails that pierced thy bleeding head,
and hands, and feet, and opened the current that flowed from thy
heart.&nbsp; Thou wast &ldquo;wounded for <i>our</i>
transgressions, and bruised for <i>our</i>
iniquities.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isa. liii. 5.&nbsp; O teach us to see
the bitterness of sin in the depth of thy sufferings, and to
stand amazed at the unexampled love that shines through them
all!&nbsp; This will embitter sin to our hearts, and endear to us
that blessed cross from whence the remedy for it flows, with the
current of thy blood.</p>
<p>There is but one leading point of view more, in which the evil
of sin is discoverable by the melancholy effects which it
produceth; and that is, by the consideration immediately
suggested in the text; which is,</p>
<p>That death is the wages of sin.&nbsp; This is a truth so
obvious, that it hardly requires any argument, either to
illustrate, or confirm it.&nbsp; The fact is, at least,
incontrovertible.&nbsp; The notoriety of it hath been established
by an intermitted series of mortality, through all the successive
generations of men, from the beginning of the <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>world to
the present day.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fathers, where are they? the
prophets, do they live for ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, though the event itself is indisputable, the cause of it,
as well as the nature of that cause, are subjects of sharp
controversy, with those, who, when unable to stand against the
evidence of facts, transfer their contentious disposition to the
revelation of God; and so wrest the scriptures to their
destruction.&nbsp; All admit, that death is the inevitable lot of
human nature, because the truth addresses our very senses.&nbsp;
But some, with strange inconsistency, insinuate, and not only
insinuate, but even attempt to give it the form of an argument,
that, though all must submit to death, yet the event is not to be
considered as the effect of the first transgression; or, at
least, that death is no penal evil, or the consequence of any
entail of original guilt: since, as they argue, it would be
inconsistent with the divine justice to punish a whole race for
the sin of an individual; and that, since so many good men die,
death ought rather to be accounted a blessing, than a
penalty.&nbsp; All this is reason as full of fallacy, as it is of
danger, and is overturned to the very foundation, by the express
authority of the word of God.&nbsp; St. Paul asserts, that
&ldquo;by <i>one</i> man, <i>sin</i> entered into the world, and
<i>death</i> by sin; and so death hath <i>passed upon all
men</i>, for that all have sinned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. v. 12.&nbsp;
Death was announced as the <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>threatened penalty to Adam before
his transgression, and it was inflicted after it, agreeably to
the decree of God.&nbsp; Why should it be penal to him and not to
his descendants?&nbsp; The text says, that death is the wages of
<i>sin</i>.&nbsp; The cause is evil, and so must the effect
produced by it.&nbsp; This is penal because that is criminal;
unless it can be proved that there is no moral evil in the
violation of the divine law, and no natural evil in an event,
that tears in sunder, and reduces to dust and ashes, that frame
which bears the impress of divine workmanship, and was originally
the seat of health, honor, and immortality.&nbsp; If ever death
turns out a blessing, it is over-ruled to that end by the grace
and providence of God.&nbsp; The cause and nature of it are not,
however, altered.&nbsp; And in every instance, it is the wages of
sin, and the desert of sinners unexceptionably and universally;
even of those &ldquo;who did not sin after the similitude of
Adam&rsquo;s transgression;&rdquo; that is, by actual sin.&nbsp;
For though all infants are undoubtedly saved, who die in infancy,
yet their death evinces previous transgression, though not
actually, yet originally and inherently.&nbsp; It is a scripture
maxim, that &ldquo;the body is dead because of sin.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The inherency and imputation of that great moral evil makes the
body obnoxious to death.&nbsp; And the seeds of both have an
existence together in the nature of every son of Adam; which, in
due time, spring up in <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>that vicious soil, and bring forth
actual transgression, and actual death.</p>
<p>If this doctrine, equally corroborated by scripture and facts,
be not admitted, the divine justice would stand impeachable for
taking off infants, whose death is often the instant successor of
their birth, and is accompanied with a train of diseases, and
agonizing pains.&nbsp; And, though in the case of them, as of
adult believers, death proves a blessing, through the redemption
that is by Christ Jesus; yet to those who continue in the
practice of sin, and die under the guilt of it, their dissolution
is the commencement of eternal woe.&nbsp; For, the wages of sin
is death, eternal as well as temporal.&nbsp; The eternal duration
of the penalty is, in that respect, proportioned to the infinite
demerit of the offence, as being committed against the sacred law
of an infinite God, and rising in aggravation according to the
dignity and majesty of the Being offended.&nbsp; The perverse
reasoning of men of corrupt minds may controvert this awful
truth, too, as unjust.&nbsp; But their quarrel is with
scripture.&nbsp; For that declares, that the wicked shall
&ldquo;go into <i>everlasting</i> punishment,&rdquo; Mat., xxv.
46, and shall &ldquo;suffer the vengeance of eternal fire,&rdquo;
never to be extinguished through ages more numerous than the
drops of the ocean, or the countless sands upon the
sea-shore.</p>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>Here
imagination might paint a scene sufficient to harrow up the soul,
and make the blood of every mortal run cold; were we to dwell
upon the sufferings of those who are lost for ever; and to
consummate and perpetuate which, the wrath of God unites with the
worm that never dies, and the fire that is never quenched.&nbsp;
I might lead you, in order to behold an exemplification of the
truth in our text, not only to beds of sickness, where the pallid
countenance, the cold sweat, and throbbing breast, indicate
death&rsquo;s near approach&mdash;to the haunts of the debauched,
or the chambers of the luxurious, where sin reigns, and death
triumphs with a long train of diseases both of body and mind, the
sad recompense of a life spent in sin and vanity&mdash;to the
dungeon&rsquo;s doleful cells, where criminals drag the galling
chain, and expect, with horror and remorse, the hour that is to
fix them to the gibbet, and make an ignominious death the wages
of their iniquity&mdash;to the church-yard, that repository of
the promiscuous dead, where the crumbled bodies of the rich and
great are not distinguishable from the dust of the earth; or to
the charnel-house, crowded with the dry and ghastly relics of
thousands, who were once flushed with health, and bloomed with
beauty, like their present gay survivors, who hardly ever spend a
serious thought on death, and live <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>as if they had made a covenant with
the grave&mdash;to the historic pages of the annalist and the
poet, recounting the horrors of the tented field, and telling
over the tens of thousands that have been cut off in the midst of
their sanguinary and ambitious schemes&mdash;I say, I might not
only lead you to these several scenes, as declarative of the
truth before us; but I might urge, as its most tremendous
completion, the state of those, who are now receiving the final
wages of sin in that lake, which burns, and shall to all eternity
burn, with inextinguishable flames.&nbsp; But I would rather wave
the description, or rather an attempt to describe, what it hath
not entered into the heart of man to conceive.&nbsp; Let us throw
a veil upon this awful scene, and pass to the consideration of
one that is as bright and glorious, as the other is gloomy and
terrible; which is, that</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;The gift of God
is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had occasion to observe, in the outset of this discourse,
that the text places, in a contrasted view, some of the principal
truths of revealed religion; that the one might serve as a foil
to the other; and that the love of God to a sinful world might
appear the more stupendous, by a consideration of the very abject
condition to which sin reduced us, and from which no <a
name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>hand was
able to extricate us, but that which made the world.</p>
<p>In this contrasted scene, the things set in opposition to each
other&mdash;are eternal life, and eternal death&mdash;the wages
of sin, and the gift of God&mdash;the disobedience of Adam, and
the righteousness of Christ&mdash;with all the calamities
springing out of sin and death, and all the rich blessings
flowing from that tree of life, whose leaves are for the healing
of the nations.&nbsp; Sin is opposed to obedience; death, to
life; the eternal duration of the one, to that of the other; the
malignity of sin and the demerit of sinners, to the undeserved
and gratuitous mercy of God, and the infinite merit of the Lord
Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Oh, that our hearts may overflow with
gratitude, when we reflect, that we have the bright side of our
text to contemplate with rapture! when, had Jehovah entered into
judgment with us, the sad subject of our meditations for ever
might have been like the superscription on Ezekiel&rsquo;s
roll&mdash;mourning, lamentation, and woe.&nbsp; But now the
voice of the Lord cheers the wilderness of our nature with that
reviving word, &ldquo;Where sin abounded, grace hath much more
abounded.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which, to a burdened sinner, is like clear
sun-shining after rain, or the return of a serene and a bright
morning after a dark tempestuous night; or like a pardon,
unexpectedly <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>brought, to a criminal under sentence of death.&nbsp;
This we shall see in what follows.</p>
<p>In Paradise, the test of man&rsquo;s obedience was the
commandment of God; the reward would have been eternal
life.&nbsp; But he sinned, and forfeited that reward in behalf of
himself and all his descendants; and the penalty incurred was as
infinite as the recompense would have been great, in case of
perfect obedience.&nbsp; To take off this forfeiture of life
eternal, and recover the inheritance that had been lost, Jesus
undertook to become the sinner&rsquo;s substitute, and to take
the penalty upon himself.&nbsp; As sin was the fatal cause of all
the misery and disorder introduced into the world, he suffered it
to be laid upon himself, and &ldquo;was made sin, that we might
be made the righteousness of God in him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The awful
penalty of a violated law fell upon him, in the day that he was
&ldquo;made a curse for us,&rdquo; Gal. iii. 13, and bled to
death as a propitiatory sacrifice on the cross.&nbsp; It was
exacted of him, and he made full payment.&nbsp; Perfect obedience
to the law, and full satisfaction to the justice of God, were the
two great branches of that righteousness, which constitutes the
matter of our justification before him.&nbsp; Death was the
consequence of Adam&rsquo;s transgression; but Jesus died, and by
his blood drew the monster&rsquo;s deadly sting, and
&ldquo;destroyed him that had the power <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>of death,
that is, the devil.&rdquo;&nbsp; Heb. ii. 14.&nbsp; And, as he
was God manifest in the flesh, his divinity communicated an
infinite sufficiency to his atonement and righteousness, to
deliver from sin and hell, and to render valid and secure the
believer&rsquo;s title to eternal life.</p>
<p>In the business of salvation, as it is God&rsquo;s most
glorious work, he is studious and jealous of having all the glory
of it.&nbsp; Accordingly, eternal life is held out in the text as
his &ldquo;gift,&rdquo; free on his part, and altogether
unmerited by those to whom this blessing is communicated.&nbsp;
We have no claim upon him even for the crumbs that fall from his
table; much less for the glory of his everlasting kingdom;
between which, and the obedience of the best, there is an
infinite disproportion.&nbsp; All in earth or heaven, necessary
to complete our happiness, is a gift.&nbsp; Christ himself, with
all his unsearchable riches, is called the gift of God.&nbsp; The
knowledge of him by faith, and the grace that calls, justifies,
and sanctifies, come under the same denomination.&nbsp; He gives
grace and glory.&nbsp; When the apostle takes a view of death, he
calls it the <i>wages</i> of sin.&nbsp; But he wisely and
designedly alters his language when he speaks of eternal
life.&nbsp; He does not say that <i>that</i> is the <i>wages</i>
of human works, or to be earned by the merit of human
obedience.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; It is the <i>gift</i> of God <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>through
Jesus Christ our Lord,&mdash;through him, because he is the
medium of all Jehovah&rsquo;s gifts, and the purchaser of all the
blessings of the new covenant.&nbsp; His atoning blood is the
great channel of conveyance for every benefit on earth, and his
righteousness the meritorious title to life eternal.&nbsp; The
crown of salvation is the unrivalled claim of that adorable
Saviour; and well doth he deserve, that it should be placed on
his royal head, since</p>
<blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s not a gift his hand bestows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But cost his
heart a groan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let not pride, therefore, presume to dispute the honor with
Jesus, or self-righteous sinners arrogate to themselves a
meritorious title to favors, of the least of which they are
altogether undeserving.&nbsp; God hath an open hand filled with
blessings for those who approach the throne of grace as needy
beggars, and supplicate mercy through Christ, as condemned
criminals.&nbsp; But the proud he beholdeth afar off, and those
that are rich in supposed goodness and personal merit, he sendeth
empty away.&nbsp; For, he resisteth the proud, but giveth grace
to the humble.&nbsp; Think not that heaven is to be purchased by
human merit, or that the eternal reward is to be earned by human
obedience.&nbsp; The purchase hath been made by the death and <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>passion of
the Son of God; and it is the merit of his blood alone that can
open the kingdom of heaven, or reverse the forfeiture which we
have incurred by original and personal transgression.&nbsp; The
scripture hath concluded all under sin.&nbsp; And the wages which
every transgressor hath earned, is eternal death.&nbsp; This is
every man&rsquo;s desert, and will be the reward of his iniquity,
if he is found out of Christ.&nbsp; No future works can make an
atonement to God for past transgressions; since, if this were
possible, Christ would have died in vain.&nbsp; Gal. ii.
21.&nbsp; Salvation is by grace, &ldquo;not of works, lest any
man should boast.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ephes. ii. 8, 9.&nbsp; And
&ldquo;we are justified freely
(&delta;&omega;&rho;&epsilon;&#8048;&nu; without a cause on our
part) by this grace, through the redemption that is in Christ
Jesus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. iii. 24.</p>
<p>The text speaks an awful language to the gay and the
dissolute, who may be said to be earning, by a hard drudgery, the
worst wages under the worst master.&nbsp; How many, in the full
career of dissipation, are so infatuated by the splendid outside
of glittering trifles, the pomps and vanities of this wicked
world, and so deluded by the hope of happiness, that phantom
which flies from them as fast as it is pursued; that to the
pursuit of sensual pleasure every consideration of honor and
virtue is sacrificed.&nbsp; Let those, who are running the same
fruitless chase, <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>remember, that though their path should be strewed with
rose-buds of delight, yet there lurk under them corroding care,
remorse, and shame, and anguish, more to be dreaded than the
poison of asps.&nbsp; If their minds are unawed by the
threatenings of the Lord, and steeled against the remonstrances
of truth, and conscience, Oh that they would but look into the
house of mourning! and behold the sad spectacle of a youth cut
off in his prime, either by a series of debaucheries, that
brought rottenness into his bones, and infamy on his reputation,
or that had been hurried to an act of desperation, the effect,
often, of frequent intoxication, infidel principles, or of
disappointed projects at the gaming table!&nbsp; Or, let them
look at yonder pale corpse, that has fallen a martyr to the
etiquette of dress and all the parade of fashion; that lived such
a life of dissipation, that she hardly ever knew there was a God,
till she saw him at his tribunal.&nbsp; Do not such instances,
while they declare the folly of mankind, loudly preach to you, ye
sons and daughters of dissipation?&nbsp; You, who flutter in
gaiety, though on the brink of ruin?&nbsp; O listen to the solemn
lecture!&nbsp; Fly from the wages of sin.&nbsp; You have sought
happiness in the world, but have been disappointed.&nbsp;
Pleasure&rsquo;s gilded bait hath promised you much, and looked
fair; but its promises <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>have been delusive, and its
enjoyment a shadow.&nbsp; Come now, and try what the gifts of God
in Christ Jesus can do for you.&nbsp; He gives a peace, which the
world cannot, and ascertains happiness, of which earth and hell
are not able to deprive.&nbsp; &ldquo;His ways are ways of
pleasantness, and all his paths are peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus hath the text set before us life and death: the one, the
wages and consequence of sin; the other, the unmerited and
glorious gift of God through the Son of his love.&nbsp; Ye who
believe the record, and see your ruin, bless the Lord for the
gift of a Saviour&mdash;for pardon through his blood, and
acceptance before the throne through his righteousness and
intercession.&nbsp; Love the Lord and trust in him at all times:
by telling of his salvation from day to day.&nbsp; You owe to
Jesus your life, and happiness; your all in earth and
heaven.&nbsp; He has given grace, and he will give glory, and
will withhold from his people no good thing.&nbsp; Since he hath
given himself, what gift can he keep back?&nbsp; He that spared
not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, will he not
also with him freely give us all things?&nbsp; Whilst, therefore,
ye highly-favored children of the Most High, ye are reviewing the
great, the unnumbered blessings, that crowd in upon you from the
streams that issue from the upper and <a name="page189"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 189</span>the nether springs; whilst you enjoy
the gifts of Providence, and are tasting the riches of divine
grace; and, whilst gratitude springs up in your hearts for favors
as distinguishing as they are undeserved; remember him, to whom
you are indebted for them all.&nbsp; And, while you are thanking
God, for life, health, food, raiment; the light of yonder sun,
and the clouds that drop fatness on the earth; for the joyful
sound of the gospel, and hearts to relish its salutary doctrines;
then look up to the fountain of all, and say, But, above all
things, everlasting praise and honor be ascribed to God for the
unspeakable gift of the Lord Jesus Christ, and an interest in his
blood and righteousness.&nbsp; Amen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">AN ALARMING
VIEW OF GOD&rsquo;S DESOLATING JUDGMENTS.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">[Preached on the Fast Day, February

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Whatever</span> <i>the heart of the

of the bold blasphemer dare to utter, the voice of unerring
wisdom declares, <i>there is a God</i>;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;And that there
is, all <i>nature</i> cries aloud.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this great primary truth, every object in creation bears
its testimony; from the first-born seraph down to the meanest
reptile; and from the great ruler of the day, down to the
minutest part of that stupendous system, of which he is, at once,
the ornament and the centre.&nbsp; The celestial, the
terrestrial, and aquatic worlds, with all their respective
inhabitants, are pregnant <a name="page191"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 191</span>with demonstration in favor of
<i>God&rsquo;s eternal power and Godhead</i>.&nbsp; Beings
rational and irrational, animate and inanimate, possessing either
spiritual, sensitive, or vegetative life; whether they walk the
earth, swim the ocean, or fly through the &aelig;rial expanse;
are so many vouchers to the existence of a supreme <span
class="smcap">Being</span>.&nbsp; Through the various orders of
the great scale of beings, from the lowest to the highest, we
behold visible traces of divinity; from the flower of the field
up to the cedar in Lebanon, from the minutest insect to the lion
that roars in the desert, or from the smallest fish that swims in
the briny flood, to the huge leviathan that taketh his pastime
therein.&nbsp; In the origin of their existence, the formation
and contexture of their frame, and the provision adapted to their
support, we behold equally the infinite wisdom and profuse
beneficence of JEHOVAH.&nbsp; Yea, the very minuti&aelig; of
creation proclaim his inimitable perfections.&nbsp; Insomuch,
that only a blade of grass, or the wing of a moth, exhibits marks
of infinite contrivance, which mock the skill and baffle the
comprehension of the most sagacious philosopher; while they read
him a loud lecture upon that great truth, &ldquo;Canst thou, by
searching, find out God? canst thou know the Almighty to
perfection?&nbsp; It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do?
deeper than <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>hell; what canst thou know?&nbsp; The measure thereof
is longer than the earth and broader than the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Job, xi. 7, 9; and chap. xii. 7, 8.</p>
<p>If, from the parts, we ascend to the great whole; or, from
contemplating some of the lower stories, we pass to a
comprehensive view of the vast fabric of the universe, what a
system of wonders rises to declare the glory and handy-work of
the supreme Architect!&nbsp; Who can behold an immense multitude
of lucid orbs, each of them <i>a world</i>, suspended in the vast
expanse, without any visible support; some of them fixed to their
stations, though of prodigious magnitude; while others, with a
velocity hardly credible, perform their revolutions, and move in
their orbits, with the nicest observance of the space and time
allotted to them;&mdash;who, I say, can observe this wonderful
machinery, without acknowledging a present <span
class="smcap">Deity</span>?&nbsp; What is the firmament of
heaven, but a golden alphabet, that in capital letters, which all
the world may read, deciphers the name, and displays the
perfections, of the all-wise God?&nbsp; Who can view the sun, in
his azure &ldquo;tabernacle,&rdquo; that fairest and brightest
image of his Creator, &ldquo;coming forth as a bridegroom out of
his chamber, and rejoicing as a strong man to run his
race,&rdquo; without confessing in him, the most glorious witness
to the existence of that <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>God who gave him to be the cheerer
of this nether world, and appointed his &ldquo;circuit,&rdquo;
Psal. xix. 6, which he has punctually performed for thousands of
years?&nbsp; Or who can contemplate the moon, the silver lamp of
night, and all the stars that glitter in her train, and not hear
the silent yet emphatic eloquence with which they publish the
praises of their great Original?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For ever singing as they shine,<br />
The hand that made us, is divine!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But man is to himself a voucher for the truth; since he is in
himself a microcosm, a little world, or an epitome of a larger
system.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am fearfully and wonderfully made,&rdquo;
Psal. cxxxix. 14, was the acknowledgment of an inspired
philosopher, when he contemplated himself; when he looked back to
his embryo-state, and traced the footsteps of that divine art, by
which his &ldquo;substance, yet imperfect, was curiously
wrought,&rdquo; or, as he considered its perfect formation by the
plastic hand of Jehovah, &ldquo;in whose book all his members
were written, which, in continuance, were fashioned, when as yet
there was none of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. cxxxix. 15, 16.&nbsp;
And, if the sight of even a shapeless skeleton, bereft of that
beauty which adorns the human frame in its perfect state, could
strike conviction into <a name="page194"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 194</span>the breast of a philosopher, <a
name="citation194"></a><a href="#footnote194"
class="citation">[194]</a> and save him from Atheism; how
forcible, how irresistible the evidence, when the same frame is
viewed in all the wise arrangement, symmetry, coherence,
usefulness, and elegant proportion of its parts!&nbsp; If human
nature, even in ruins, can thus speak loudly for the divinity of
its Maker; what an emphasis of demonstration must it give, to
view the fabric complete, and forming, by the inhabitation of the
soul, a rational and immortal being!&nbsp; So that it is as great
a reflection upon the head, as upon the heart of that man, who,
amidst all the evidence that surrounds and dwells in him,
continues an unbelieving sceptic: and it would be difficult,
perhaps, to determine, whether there be more folly or blasphemy
in genuine Atheism.</p>
<p>But, while all creation echoes the voice, and implicitly
demonstrates the existence of God, so as to &ldquo;leave without
excuse those, who worshipped and served the creature more than
(&mu;&alpha;&lambda;&lambda;&omicron;&nu; &rsquo;&eta; <i>rather
than</i>, or <i>and not</i>) the Creator;&rdquo; Rom. i. 25; yet
it is to Revelation we are indebted for that information
respecting the nature, works, and dispensations of Jehovah, which
<a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>the most
refined systems of human wisdom have never been able to give
us.&nbsp; In the sacred volume, we receive more instruction from
a single page, and often from one short sentence, than from whole
volumes of antiquity; and more truth too, than all the elaborate
systems of philosophers and speculatists have been able to
investigate for thousands of years.&nbsp; What they groped after
by the dim light of reason, is here revealed to the full
satisfaction of the most illiterate inquirer.&nbsp; And what
their schemes attempted to elucidate, and, in elucidating, only
made more obscure and absurd, is here unfolded in a manner, that
exhibits indubitable marks of divine authenticity, and affords an
opportunity to &ldquo;the wayfaring man, though a fool,&rdquo; to
surpass in genuine knowledge the most renowned philosopher, who
either had not, or would not have, the &ldquo;oracles of
God,&rdquo; for his counsellor and guide.&nbsp; Here we are
informed not only that God is, but also, &ldquo;that he is the
rewarder of them that diligently seek him;&rdquo; Heb. xi.
6;&mdash;that &ldquo;the worlds were framed by the word of
God;&rdquo; verse 3;&mdash;that they did not exist from eternity,
as some of the philosophers whimsically maintained, but that
&ldquo;<i>in the beginning</i>, God created the heavens and the
earth;&rdquo; Gen. i. 1;&mdash;that the frame of the universe was
not formed from pre-existing materials, for that &ldquo;the
things <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>which are seen, were not made of things which do
appear;&rdquo; Heb. xi. 3;&mdash;that, contrary, to the
atheistical and stupid hypothesis of the Epicureans, who ascribed
the creation of all things to chance, or a fortuitous concourse
of atoms; the world and all its inhabitants were the production
of an eternal, infinitely intelligent, spiritual, wise, and
powerful Being, whom the scriptures call God;&mdash;that he,
whose almighty <i>fiat</i> from darkness educed light, and from
the confusion of chaos brought harmony and order, was the very
person, who afterwards disrobed himself of his divine splendor,
and &ldquo;was manifest in the flesh, took upon him the form of a
servant, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the
cross.&rdquo;&nbsp; Phil. ii. 7, 8.&nbsp; For, by him, &ldquo;in
whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness
of sins, and who is the&rdquo; express &ldquo;image of the
invisible God, were all things created, that are in heaven, and
that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be
thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things
were created <i>by</i> him,&rdquo; as the Agent, &ldquo;and
<i>for</i> him,&rdquo; as the <i>End</i>.&nbsp; Col. ii. 14,
15;&mdash;that all the calamities which prevail in the natural
and moral world originate in that act of disobedience recorded in
Gen. iii. 6,&mdash;and that the great remedy provided by infinite
Mercy and Wisdom for sin and its bitter effects, <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>is Jesus,
the adorable Prince of Peace, who &ldquo;gave himself for us, an
<i>offering</i> and a <i>sacrifice</i> to God, for a
sweet-smelling savor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ephes. v. 2.</p>
<p>While the sacred writings open to guilty mortals a prospect of
life and immortality, through the revelation of a system of
truth, peculiar to themselves; they throw light upon the
dispensations of Providence, by assuring us, that all things
great and minute, are under the control and superintendence of an
omniscient Being, who numbers the very hairs of our head, and
suffers not even &ldquo;a sparrow to fall to the ground&rdquo;
without his sovereign permission; that, although the grounds of
the divine dispensations are often inscrutable to human
penetration, and form a great deep, which finite intelligences
cannot fathom; yet that infinite wisdom presides in them all, and
will render them subservient to his own glory, and his
people&rsquo;s good; and that, whatever happens, respecting the
fate of empires and states, and all other grand revolutions upon
the globe, that display either the goodness or the severity of
God, fall out according to the positive design of <span
class="smcap">Him</span>, who &ldquo;doeth what seemeth him meet
among the armies of heaven and the inhabitants of the earth; of
whom, and <i>through</i> whom, and <i>to</i> whom, are all
things.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. xi. 36.</p>
<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>With
the volume of inspiration in our hands, and the concurrence of
innumerable facts confirming the evidence which it adduceth to
the certainty of the preceding truths; let us, upon the present
solemn occasion, First, take a view of some of those tremendous
works of Jehovah, which, while they speak his existence and
interposition, proclaim his wrath; and then, secondly, consider,
in what light, and with what temper, we should contemplate such
portentous dealings.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come, behold the works of the
Lord; what desolations he hath made in the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; There are some works of Jehovah, which proclaim his
benignity and tender mercy.&nbsp; All his dispensations are big
with a display of these most attractive and endearing
attributes.&nbsp; They crown his providence, and shine forth with
brightest lustre in the boundless riches of grace.&nbsp; Every
land is witness to his patience, and equally so to the vast
profusion of his all-bounteous munificence.&nbsp; The earth is
full of the goodness of the Lord; and all nature smiles under the
tender mercies of our God.&nbsp; And, were this the proper place,
or would the reference of our text admit of the digression, we
might take a view of that beautiful scene, painted by an inspired
hand, and in the most sublime imagery, in <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>Psal. lxv.
8&ndash;13.&nbsp; We might meditate, with rapture and with
profit, on those works of paternal goodness, which &ldquo;the
outgoings of the morning and the evening rejoice&rdquo; to
publish; when the Father of Mercies makes his &ldquo;paths to
drop fatness on the pastures of the wilderness,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;crowneth&rdquo; the opening and closing &ldquo;year with
his goodness;&rdquo; when pastures clothed with flocks, and
valleys covered over with corn, &ldquo;make the little hills
rejoice on every side,&rdquo; give an universal festivity and
gaiety to the face of nature, and &ldquo;shout for joy&rdquo; in
praise of nature&rsquo;s God.&nbsp; Or we may pass to a
contemplation of a still more enrapturing scene, which the former
but faintly pictures; I mean that of the human heart emerging
from darkness and from barrenness under the propitious rays of
the &ldquo;Sun of Righteousness,&rdquo; softened by the dew of
divine grace, watered by the divine Spirit, that &ldquo;river of
God which is full of water,&rdquo; clothed with that <i>best
robe</i>, the Redeemer&rsquo;s righteousness, and transformed
from a wilderness into a little Eden, flourishing like the garden
of God.&nbsp; Or, we might fix our meditations on that most
gracious and most stupendous work of infinite mercy, the
redemption of sinners through <span class="smcap">Jesus
Christ</span>.&nbsp; A work this, which is the great labor of the
skies, and the grandest work of God; on which the believer
employs his sweetest meditations, <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>and from which he derives his
brightest hopes.</p>
<p>But the subject of the text, as well as the solemnity of the
day, calls us, for the present, to consider <i>other</i> works,
in which, not the olive-branch of peace, but the rod of
vindictive justice, is held forth; where not the goodness, but
the severity of God, is the chief object; in which the desolation
of the earth is his awful purpose; and by which he speaks, not in
the still small voice of mercy and benignity, but in accents more
awful than the noise of conflicting elements, and more tremendous
than the sound of ten thousand thunders.&nbsp; &ldquo;For, behold
the Lord cometh out of his place to <i>punish</i> the inhabitants
of the earth for their <i>iniquity</i>; therefore let all the
earth keep silence before him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isa. xxvi. 21.&nbsp;
Hab. ii. 20.</p>
<p>Whether we consider the desolating <i>works</i> themselves, or
the <i>instruments</i>, by which they have been accomplished, we
shall have abundant cause, in either view, to acknowledge the
finger of God, and to confess, that &ldquo;he ruleth in the
kingdoms of the earth, and is very greatly to be feared in the
assembly of the saints;&rdquo; that he is &ldquo;glorious in
holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; As to the works themselves, they reach as far as the
utmost extent of the terraqueous globe, <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>and are as
numerous as the several countries, kingdoms, or insular
districts, into which it is divided by intervening mountains, or
intersected by the currents of the ocean.&nbsp; There is not a
spot of any considerable extent upon the earth, that has not, in
some period or other, experienced the desolating hand of Jehovah;
nor can the history of any nation be produced, whose annals do
not record some awful visitation, through which he hath
&ldquo;answered&rdquo; its inhabitants &ldquo;by <span
class="GutSmall">TERRIBLE THINGS</span> in righteousness;&rdquo;
Psal. lxv. 5, and forced even pagan nations &ldquo;that dwell in
the uttermost parts of the earth to be afraid at the <span
class="GutSmall">TOKENS</span>&rdquo; of his existence and
indignation.&nbsp; Indeed, what is the earth, but one vast
theatre, on which have been exhibited the successive scenes of
mercy and of judgment? bearing, under its various revolutions,
visible inscriptions of a divine hand, and visible traces of
divine power? and in such phenomena, as might make even an
atheist to cry out, &ldquo;Thou, even thou, art to be feared; and
who may stand in thy sight when thou art angry?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Psal. lxxvi. 7.</p>
<p>But, if we consult the sacred writings, those infallible
records of God&rsquo;s works and ways; in them we shall meet with
the most numerous and prominent testimonies to the truth before
us.&nbsp; There we read of that great work of desolation,
produced by an universal deluge; when <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>the earth suffered the most dreadful
disruption of its parts; when &ldquo;the fountains of the great
deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were
opened;&rdquo; Gen. vii. 11; when descending cataracts from the
clouds meeting with ascending torrents from the great abyss,
formed that vast congregation of waters, which overspread the
earth, and covered the summits of its loftiest hills; when sin
received an indelible mark of its abominable nature, the
inhabitants of the earth met with the just desert of their
accumulated iniquities, and the earth itself was reduced to such
a state of desolation, as can only be exceeded by the terrors of
that day, when a different element shall be employed to
consummate its final and total wreck; when a flood of fire shall
finish, what a deluge of water began, and intermediate
desolations have been carrying on for thousands of years; and
when God shall accomplish all his works of judgment and of mercy,
to the eternal ruin of the wicked, and the complete redemption of
his own people.</p>
<p>Although Jehovah hath set his <i>bow</i> in the clouds, as the
significant symbol of that covenant, which he made with Noah, for
the security of the earth from another general inundation, and of
a better covenant established through Christ, whereby the
salvation of his people from a deluge of divine wrath is
ascertained; yet, if <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>we examine the subsequent
dispensations of Jehovah, they will evince, that post-diluvian
wickedness has received marks of divine displeasure, in a
constant succession of desolating judgments.&nbsp; Of this let
the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah be a standing proof; whose
inhabitants, for their unnatural lust, were visited with a
judgment which served as a prelude and a pledge of that
&ldquo;vengeance of eternal fire,&rdquo; Jude 7, which they were
to &ldquo;suffer&rdquo; as the reward of their crimes; while all
the cities of the plain, converted into a fetid lake, or <i>dead
sea</i>, whose foul exhalations spread barrenness and death all
around it, exhibit, as long as the earth itself lasteth, an awful
memorandum of the effects of sin, and the judgments of a
sin-avenging God.</p>
<p>Or, if the truth require further illustration, let us visit
Egypt, and see what &ldquo;signs Jehovah wrought there, and what
wonders in the field of Zoan,&rdquo; Psal. lxxviii. where he
&ldquo;smote all their first-born and the chief of their strength
in the tabernacles of Ham;&rdquo; where a succession of plagues,
desolating their country, and depopulating its inhabitants,
terminated at last in the destruction of Pharaoh and his host in
the Red Sea.&nbsp; What a scene must that land exhibit, wherein
the nutritive parts of creation were impregnated with poison and
death! the most innocent creatures became a dreadful annoyance!
<a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>the most
useful animals were visited with sickness! the very dust of the
ground converted into loathsome insects! the light of heaven
changed into &ldquo;darkness that might be felt!&rdquo; the
first-born of man and beast cut off in a night! the survivors
trembling for themselves, and shrieking for the dead! while every
element was armed with vengeance, and conspired to complete the
desolation.&nbsp; Yet such was the scene, when God sent tokens
and wonders into thee, O thou land of Egypt!</p>
<p>But the time would fail me to tell of Moab, and of Babylon; of
populous Nineveh, or of imperial Rome; and of Jerusalem, the city
of the great King; of the various nations, tribes, and people, to
which these mighty cities gave names of pomp and
distinction,&mdash;of the various revolutions which they have
severally undergone, in the course of providence;&mdash;of the
captivities of some, the conquests of others, and the desolation
of all.&nbsp; The history of Israel from their Exodus out of
Egypt, to their settlement in Canaan, with their journeyings
through the wilderness inclusive, principally contains a
narrative of their sins and of God&rsquo;s judgments; nor does
the history of the Jews, through their several captivities, and
defections from the Lord, diminish, but rather swell, the
dreadful account; as we view them, from the revolt and dispersion
<a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>of ten
tribes, down to the final subjection of the residue to the Roman
yoke; an event, which, by a judicial chain of providence, rapidly
brought on the melancholy catastrophe, which ended in the ruin of
their city and temple, and marked that awful &aelig;ra, in which
they ceased to be a people.&nbsp; &ldquo;How unsearchable are
God&rsquo;s judgments, and his ways past finding
out!&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. xi. 33.</p>
<p>Admitting that there is a God, who created and now governeth
the universal frame of nature, a truth, as we have seen, founded
upon the most incontestable evidence both of his word and
works&mdash;it follows of course, that He can never be at a loss
for expedients to assert his sovereignty, and vindicate his
injured laws.&nbsp; As the heavens and the earth are his
property, he can, with as much equity as ease, summon either or
both to act in his controversy with a guilty world.&nbsp; His own
creation will, at all times, furnish him with ample materials for
conducting his judicial dispensations; insomuch, that every
creature might be armed against us, and every element be made the
vehicle of destruction; or the divine appointment might make the
very food we eat, or the air we breathe, the channels to convey
instantaneous death.&nbsp; But our business is not now to
consider these ordinary incidents, by which &ldquo;the King of
terrors&rdquo; is continually peopling the regions of the dead,
and <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>to
which the constitution of our frame is subject; but rather those
awful instruments of divine visitation, which are scourges of the
Almighty to a guilty world.&nbsp; And one of the most fatal of
these, is</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">War</span>.&nbsp; This, howsoever
necessary and inevitable it may often be, is always to be
esteemed a great evil; if we advert, either to its origination or
its effects; and nothing can justify its exertions, but the laws
of self-preservation.&nbsp; The sin of man first gave it an
existence; and the same bitter cause continues it to this
day.&nbsp; &ldquo;From whence come wars and fightings among you?
come they not hence, even from your lusts?&rdquo;&nbsp; James,
iv. 1.&nbsp; Tyrannical passions predominating in the mind, give
birth to those sanguinary schemes, which, when pursued, produce
every species of confusion and death.&nbsp; If we examine
carefully, from whence all those scenes of devastation have
arisen, that have deluged the world with blood, we shall find,
that, in general, they have sprung from unbounded ambition,
avarice, pride, or resentment.&nbsp; And multitudes of tyrants,
as well as factious confederates in usurpation and rebellion,
have never been able, in thousands of cases, to assign any other
reason for their enterprises in blood and slaughter, but this;
that the one could not bear an equal, nor the other a superior;
or those had <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>too little, and these not enough.&nbsp; While, to
foment the dreadful quarrel, the lust of revenge and rebellion
operates like oil poured on the flame.&nbsp; Thus nations begin
and carry on war, until they are tired of worrying and killing
one another; and when the consequences of this horrid work are
weighed in the balance of humanity and reason, many a conqueror
may sit down and weep over his victories, when he reflects that
they have been purchased at the expense of the blood of thousands
of his fellow-creatures.&nbsp; And he who could contemplate such
victories with pride or pleasure, unmixed with remorse and
compassion for the sorrow, the ruin, the desolation they have
caused, is a desperate character, that, one would hope, can meet
with a parallel, only in</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align:

</blockquote>
<p>What desolations have been made in the earth by war, the
history of former and latter ages informs us; and, God knoweth,
<i>we</i> need no comment on the awful truth.&nbsp; What we want
principally, is to be humbled under the visitation; to
&ldquo;hear the rod, and Him that appointed it.&rdquo;&nbsp; For,
we are sure the matter is not fortuitous.&nbsp; If the sword be
drawn, it is because God hath said, &ldquo;Sword go through this
land.&rdquo;&nbsp; Or, if it continue unsheathed, it is because
he hath <a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>said also, &ldquo;O thou <i>sword of the Lord</i>, how
long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thyself into thy
scabbard, rest, and be still.&nbsp; How can it be quiet, seeing
the Lord <i>hath given it a charge</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Jer. xlvii.
6, 7.&nbsp; Or, if wide-extended destruction mark its progress,
it is because, &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord, A sword, a sword is
sharpened, and also furbished; it is sharpened to make a sore
slaughter; should we then make mirth?&nbsp; The sword is
sharpened, to give it into the <i>hand of the slayer</i>.&nbsp;
<i>I</i> Jehovah have set the point of the sword against all
their gates, that their hearts may faint, and their <i>ruins be
multiplied</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ezek. xxi. 9&ndash;11, 15.</p>
<p>These awful passages intimate, that it is an act of justice in
God, to appoint that evil, into which men&rsquo;s inordinate
passions precipitate them: and it may turn out an act of mercy
too, if they see their sin in their punishment, and get sick of
both.&nbsp; Otherwise additional expedients may be adopted, and
increasing judgments be sent.&nbsp; For, the Lord hath at his
command the</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Pestilence</span>.&nbsp; When
David, for his sin in numbering the people of Israel, had
proposed to him his choice of three modes of punishment, and he
preferred falling into the hand of the Lord, for very great were
his mercies, and not into the hand of man, whose tender mercies,
<a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>often,
are cruel; &ldquo;the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel, and
there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Chron.
xxi. 12&ndash;14.&nbsp; This sore visitation, which sin brought
upon David and his people, was often repeated among the other
judgments which desolated Israel.&nbsp; See Lev. xxvi. 25.&nbsp;
Psal. lxxviii. 50.&nbsp; Jer. xliv. 13.&nbsp; It is mentioned as
one of the ominous antecedents of the day of judgment, that
&ldquo;there shall be <i>pestilence</i> in divers
places.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mat. xxiv. 7.&nbsp; And in that inimitable
piece of sublime description in Habak. iii. where all nature is
represented as convulsed and shrinking to nothing, under
impressions of the indignation and grandeur of God, &ldquo;before
him,&rdquo; it is said, &ldquo;went the <i>pestilence</i>:&rdquo;
verse 5.&nbsp; Because of the secret manner in which this fearful
visitant performs his work, the Psalmist saith, &ldquo;the
pestilence walketh in darkness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. xci. 6.&nbsp;
He enters silently and secretly as the thief, and imperceptibly
yet rapidly executes his commission.&nbsp; There is often no
security against its approach, since the air we breathe wafts the
deadly contagion to all the senses, which, in a moment, convey
them to, and, in conveying, contaminate the whole mass of
blood.&nbsp; Thousands imbibe the poison, and fall in agonies
under the stroke.&nbsp; The bolted door is no barrier against its
intrusion; the power of medicine no antidote to the <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>noisome
malady.&nbsp; Thousands and tens of thousands fall on the right
hand and on the left; and it has been known that this sweeping
scourge has often swelled the bills of mortality more in a few
weeks, than the whole train of common diseases have in as many
years.&nbsp; Never do death&rsquo;s arrows fly so thick or so
envenomed, as when he fills his quiver with the plague; and never
is the grave so crowded with dead, as when the pestilence waiteth
at its gates.&nbsp; Though the land before it should resemble the
garden of Eden, yet behind it the scene will be like a desolate
wilderness.&nbsp; And were it not for that hand, which guides its
progress, and limits its commission, nothing but rapid desolation
and destruction would ensue; especially if we consider, that
there follows close at his heels,</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Famine</span>.&nbsp; As bread is
the staff of life, if the prop be removed, the constitution must
necessarily fall.&nbsp; The vitals deprived of their wonted
nutriment, must languish and die, under one of the most painful
and insatiate sensations of nature.&nbsp; As famine is an evil in
effect, the causes which produce it may be various.&nbsp; The
spread of war, the want, or excess of rain, parching or vitiating
the fruits of the earth, great inundations, blasting and mildew,
long sieges, intense heat, a long frost or multitudes of
devouring insects, locusts in particular, called by <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>one of the
prophets, &ldquo;God&rsquo;s army,&rdquo; may, and often have, in
their turns, introduced the plague of famine.&nbsp; But who can
describe, or bear a description of such scenes as those which
mark the effects of this pale visitant! when, as in
Samaria&rsquo;s siege, those things which the stomach would
nauseate the very mention of, in a time of plenty, are coveted as
food, when the unhappy sufferers have been driven to the horrid
necessity of turning cannibals, and casting lots for each
others&rsquo; persons, till at last a want of every resource
brings death, and closes the ghastly scene.&nbsp; A visitation
this, one would think, sufficient to alarm and reform a careless
people; and yet it is recorded, as an astonishing instance of
stupidity and hardness of heart in Israel, that when God
&ldquo;gave them <i>cleanness of teeth</i> in all their cities,
and want of bread in all their places, they returned not&rdquo;
unto him that smote them.&nbsp; Amos, iv. 6.&nbsp; So that divine
justice was obliged to repeat the stroke, by that, which is of
all others the most tremendous visitation of Jehovah, the</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Earthquake</span>.&nbsp; Of all
judicial dispensations, that which appoints the earthquake, is
the most terribly vindictive; when the earth, thrown into
dreadful concussions, cracks and opens like the gaping grave, or
heaves and swells like the agitated ocean.&nbsp; Even the sword,
<a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>the
pestilence, and the famine, are mild in their effects, and slow
in their progress, when compared with the earthquake.&nbsp; It
often gives no warning, but overwhelms in a moment.&nbsp; Its
subterraneous motions tear the bowels of the earth, and make its
solid pillars bend, like a reed shaken with the wind; while the
sound of thunder from beneath, and the crash of falling
structures from above, are often heard at the same instant.&nbsp;
A few minutes put a period to the works of ages; to
wisdom&rsquo;s archives; to all the boasted monuments of conquest
and of fame; to all the pageantry of the great, and all the
hoarded riches of the wealthy; to all the illicit pleasures of
the licentious, and all the busy schemes of the proud or factious
contending for sway.&nbsp; The loftiest towers, the strongest
rocks, afford no hiding-place from its fury, but often increase
the ruin.&nbsp; Nor is there any security in flight; since in the
open field or spacious plain, a yawning gulf may open and devour
multitudes in an instant, or jam them between the closing
earth.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tremendous issue! to the sable deep,<br />
Thousands descend in business, or asleep.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the desolations which this messenger of Almighty vengeance
has spread through the earth, let Lima, Callao, Catania, Jamaica,
Lisbon, <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>bear witness.&nbsp; In the last place, soon after the
dreadful visitation which, in 1755, disturbed the procession of
the cursed <i>Auto de fe</i>, and shook the foundations of that
bloody tribunal, which Popish barbarity and superstition had set
up; the king of Portugal represented his distresses to the king
of Spain in a letter, in which was the following affecting
passage:&mdash;&ldquo;I am without a house, living in a tent;
without subjects, without servants, without money, and without
bread.&rdquo;&nbsp; How humiliating the stroke, which reduces
royalty to the dust, or brings all the dignity of crowned heads
to a level with the common beggar!&nbsp; Such, but accompanied
with circumstances infinitely more terrible and abasing, will
that final catastrophe be, when &ldquo;the Lord shall arise to
shake terribly the earth; when it shall reel to and fro like a
drunkard, and shall be removed like a cottage; and the
transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall
and not rise again;&rdquo; Isa. xxiv. 20; when &ldquo;the
loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men
shall be made low, and they shall go into the holes of the rocks,
and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for
the glory of his majesty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isa. ii. 17, 19.</p>
<p>The quiver of Jehovah is not yet exhausted, though we take
into our account the ravages of <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>war, the desolation of famine, the
fatal effects of the noisome pestilence, or the overwhelming fury
of the earthquake.&nbsp; When he &ldquo;opens his armoury, he can
bring forth&rdquo; innumerable &ldquo;weapons of his
indignation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jer. l. 25.&nbsp; He can execute his
tremendous purposes by &ldquo;fire and hail, snow and
vapor.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. cxlviii. 8, or &ldquo;fulfil his
word&rdquo; of threatening and promise, by</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Storms</span> and <span
class="smcap">Tempests</span>.&nbsp; These are nothing more than
the violent and unnatural agitation of that circumambient air, in
which we live and breathe; and which might at any time be excited
to such a degree of fearful perturbation, as to discharge some of
the most dreadful artillery of heaven.&nbsp; What secret laws
produce these phenomena are only known to that God, whose
&ldquo;way is in the whirlwind and in the storm, who maketh the
clouds the dust of his feet, and holdeth the winds in the hollow
of his hand.&rdquo;&nbsp; For their dreadful effects we have no
occasion to look very far back.&nbsp; The close of the last year
exhibited a scene of desolation in the western islands, which
their inhabitants can never forget; and in reviewing which, we
ought to be actuated with sentiments of the tenderest
commiseration and benevolence towards the unhappy sufferers, as
well as with impressions full of reverential awe of that God, who
sends his judgments through the earth, that the inhabitants <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>thereof
might learn righteousness.&nbsp; A few outlines of the
devastation occasioned by the late hurricanes, will, it is
presumed, convince us of this.&mdash;After the storm began, which
had been preceded by weather remarkably calm, but by a sky
surprisingly red and fiery; the wind was so impetuous as to bear
down every object that stood in its way, with a sudden breaking
in of the sea, in some places, which swept every thing away with
it, so as not to leave the smallest vestige of man, beast, or
house, behind; <a name="citation215a"></a><a href="#footnote215a"
class="citation">[215a]</a> and all this scene of horror and
desolation heightened by repeated shocks of an earthquake.&nbsp;
In one island, <a name="citation215b"></a><a href="#footnote215b"
class="citation">[215b]</a> we have been informed, that not ten
houses survived the fury of the storm.&nbsp; Whole families were
buried in the ruins of their habitations; and many, in attempting
to escape, were maimed, and disabled.&nbsp; A general convulsion
of nature seemed to take place, and universal destruction
ensued.&nbsp; On the one hand, might be seen the ground covered
with mangled bodies; and on the other, reputable families
wandering through the ruins, seeking for food and shelter.&nbsp;
Every building and plantation was levelled with the ground; trees
were torn up by the roots, or <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>stripped of their branches; and the
most luxuriant spring was changed, in one night, to the dreariest
winter.&nbsp; In vain was it to look for shelter, when all was a
general wreck before the sweeping tempest.&nbsp; Many fell
victims to the violence of the winds; and great numbers were
driven into the sea and there perished, to the amount of <i>some
thousands</i>.&nbsp; Alarming consequences were dreaded from the
multitudes of dead bodies which lay uninterred: while, to
complete the dismal scene, inevitable famine seemed to stare the
miserable survivors in the face.&nbsp; This description includes
the calamities of a single island; and, when to these we add,
what other islands belonging to us and our enemies suffered by a
similar visitation, how accumulated must the loss be of property
and of lives!&nbsp; And who can help, in a reflection upon such
events, crying out, &ldquo;Who in the heaven can be compared unto
the Lord! who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto
Jehovah!&nbsp; Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and
high is thy right hand; justice and judgment are the habitation
of thy throne.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. lxxxix. 6, 13, 14.</p>
<p>I presume not to decide on the particular designs or
intentions of Providence, in selecting some parts of the earth
for a manifestation of his power, while others remain untouched;
<a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>much
less do the scriptures warrant us to conclude, that exemplary
sufferers are necessarily &ldquo;sinners <i>above</i>&rdquo; the
rest of the world.&nbsp; A hasty conclusion of this nature would
reflect highly on our candor and humility, and involve in it too,
a bold usurpation of the prerogative of God, to explore and
distinguish the grounds of his own dispensations.&nbsp; And,
indeed, the late visitation was so indiscriminate, as to leave us
no room to draw inferences, either flattering to ourselves, or
insulting to our enemies.&nbsp; And, perhaps, the impartiality
and severity, which have marked these recent calamities, in their
application, might serve to prove, that powers exhausting blood
and treasure in a contest for the empty names of power and sway,
are both wrong; when <span class="smcap">Jehovah</span> seems to
take up the controversy, and to punish both.&nbsp; One thing we
cannot help seeing; which is, that if the Most High God were to
exercise his power, as he is able, or, as we deserve, the
necessity of waging or carrying on war would be very soon
superseded; for there would exist no belligerent powers to do
either the one or the other.&nbsp; We talk of our fleets and
armies, and record with triumph the mighty achievements of our
heroes; but, behold! the Almighty accomplishes in a few hours,
what the armies of the earth are not able to effect in numerous
campaigns!</p>
<p><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>We
may, however, safely conclude in general, that if &ldquo;there be
evil in a city, the Lord hath done it,&rdquo; as the scriptures
peremptorily affirm.&nbsp; That is, if any part of the earth is
visited with evils or calamities, the agency of God, either
permissive or decretive, is to be acknowledged in them.&nbsp; We
may with equal safety infer, too, that all the judgments
originate from, and imply the existence of, <i>sin</i>; since it
would be an impeachment of his justice, to suppose, that he would
suffer the elements to conspire to man&rsquo;s ruin, if there
were nothing in human nature to provoke his wrath.&nbsp; But this
leads me to consider</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; In what light, and with what temper, we ought to
contemplate such portentous dealings.</p>
<p>If we consider the works themselves, they should teach us the
great evil of sin; if we reflect on the great author of them,
they should impress us with a reverential awe of his tremendous
majesty, and a dread of his wrath; or, if we have any just idea
of our own character as sinners and mortals, they should preach
to our hearts the necessity of seeking the great means of
conciliating the divine favor, that we may be prepared for those
contingencies, which render our existence upon earth so very
precarious, and proclaim the folly of those who seek terrestrial
good to the fatal injury of their everlasting <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>interests.&nbsp; If we are Christians, we should
contemplate the works of Jehovah, with confidence and joy; and,
standing at a distance equally from presumption and unbelief,
should rejoice with trembling that the great Ruler of the
Universe is our Father and our God; while we feel ourselves
encompassed with the most forcible motives to love his name and
obey his will.&nbsp; But if, instead of living as Christians, any
of us should be sunk in ignorance, dissipated by pleasure, supine
in carelessness, and immersed in sin; we should awake from the
fatal lethargy, and fly from the wrath to come, ere death
overtake us, and judgment fix our miserable and eternal doom.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The desolating works of God are intended to display
the heinous nature of <i>sin</i>.&nbsp; All the evils which
overspread the natural and moral world spring from this
source.&nbsp; Sin is the great parent-evil, to which, as to a
bitter and common fountain, may be traced every corruption that
has depraved the heart, every malady that has invaded the human
frame, and every judgment that has rent the earth.&nbsp; All the
disorder of jarring elements, all the commotions in contending
nations, all the convulsions that shake the globe, and all the
dispensations that sweep away its inhabitants, imply its
existence, and publish its malignity.&nbsp; The sin of man
&ldquo;is <a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>written as with a pen of iron, and the point of a
diamond, on the tables of the heart,&rdquo; and stands engraven,
in capital characters, upon his words and actions; while all the
dispensations of God, directed to the great end of obliterating
the writing, shew how enormous that evil must be, which requires
the exertions of omnipotence either to punish or reform.&nbsp;
Come, ye, who think or speak lightly of sin, and see what
desolations it hath occasioned in the earth.&nbsp; Look at the
ruins of mighty cities, the depopulation of flourishing states,
and the fall of great empires, and then say, whether it be a
small thing to sin against God.&nbsp; View the first rebellious
pair expelled their earthly Paradise; their sinful progeny swept
away with a flood; the earth cursed for the sin of man; and all
the generations that are past buried in the promiscuous ruin of
the grave; and entertain, if you can, low thoughts of the evil,
that has produced these dire effects.&nbsp; Or, if this complex
scene of misery and desolation does not sufficiently display
sin&rsquo;s enormity; examine death&rsquo;s quiver, review the
envenomed shafts that fill it; count over the formidable names of
war, pestilence, earthquake, famine, tempest, fire, with the
numerous train of bodily and mental disorders; and then if you
ask, what has given such strength to the arm of the King of
terrors, <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>and such execution to the deadly arrows upon the string
of this insatiate archer? an apostle informs you, that &ldquo;the
sting of death is <span class="GutSmall">SIN</span>, and the
strength of sin is the law; 1 Cor. xv. 56; that by one man <span
class="GutSmall">SIN</span> entered into the world, and <span
class="GutSmall">DEATH</span> <i>by</i> sin, and so death passeth
upon all men, for that <span class="GutSmall">ALL HAVE
SINNED</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. v. 12.&nbsp; But, should this
representation not answer the end of convincing some of you, that
sin is an abomination of such enormity, give me leave to ask,
&ldquo;Wherefore hell hath enlarged herself and opened her mouth
without measure?&rdquo;&nbsp; Isa. v. 4.&nbsp; What kindled the
flames of Tophet? what awakened the wrath of God? or what exposed
his Son to the bitter agonies of the cross?&nbsp; In each
dreadful view, <i>sin</i> is the instrumental cause.&nbsp; The
sufferings of Jesus, the torments of the damned, proclaim its
God-provoking nature.&nbsp; Go then, sinner, and after you have
in thought traversed the globe, and seen its desolations; after
you have dropped a tear over the monuments of the dead, and
looked with horror into the chambers of the grave; go, and visit
Calvary.&nbsp; See who hangs there in agonies and shame.&nbsp;
What means this affecting scene?&nbsp; Wherefore is the sun
darkened, and why are the rocks rent?&nbsp; Why does the
immaculate Jesus thus suffer and die, while nature feels the
shock, and sympathizes with strong convulsions?&nbsp; <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span><i>Sin</i>,
<i>thy</i> sin is at the bottom of this tragic scene.&nbsp; This
was the bitter ingredient in the Redeemer&rsquo;s cup, the dregs
of which he drank off in our stead.&nbsp; This was the
intolerable burden which he bore for us; and which in the bearing
sunk him to the grave.&nbsp; Say then, must not that be a great
evil, which is the cause of such calamities to man, and of such
incomprehensible sufferings to the &ldquo;Son of man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But do we see this? and are we affected at the sight?&nbsp; We
are assembled together for the purpose of humbling ourselves
before Almighty God, on account of &ldquo;our manifold
<i>sins</i> and <i>provocations</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Do the feelings
of our hearts correspond with the profession of our lips?&nbsp;
Do we <i>mean</i> what we say?&nbsp; Is it not to be feared, that
many content themselves with a repetition of a devotional form,
adapted to the present occasion, without ever entering into the
spirit of it? and hereby add to that immense load of
inconsistency and guilt, which similar conduct has been
increasing for numbers of years?&nbsp; And does not melancholy
matter of fact demonstrate, that we are guilty of no breach of
truth or charity, when we assert, that multitudes mock Jehovah to
his face, by loving and living in the secret practice of those
very sins, which, on this day, they condemn with their
lips?&nbsp; We profess to regret the continuance of war, and <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>to lament
the expense of blood and treasure incurred by it.&nbsp; But, if
our eyes are shut to the real cause of the evil, the visitation
may be lengthened out, until we are at last forced to read our
sin in our punishment.&nbsp; For, whatever some may think, war is
a grievous scourge of the Almighty, permitted as a chastisement
for crying sins, and a loud call to the nations of the earth to
repent and turn to God.&nbsp; Hear what the Lord saith by the
prophets.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thy way and thy doings have procured these
things unto thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter,
because it reacheth unto thine heart: therefore destruction upon
destruction is cried.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jer. iv. 18, 20.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Because</i> they have cast away the <i>law</i> of the
Lord of Hosts, and despised the <i>word</i> of the Holy One of
Israel; therefore the anger of the Lord is kindled against his
people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and
hath smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses
were torn in the midst of the streets.&nbsp; For all this his
anger is not turned away, but his <span class="GutSmall">HAND IS
STRETCHED OUT STILL</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isa. v. 25.&nbsp; And,
in that long list of threatenings recorded in Lev. xxvi. among
other denunciations, is the following:&mdash;&ldquo;If ye will
not be reformed by me by these things, but will walk contrary
unto me, then will I also walk contrary to you, and will punish
you yet <i>seven</i> <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span><i>times</i> for your sins; and I
will bring <i>a sword</i> upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel
of my covenant.&rdquo;&nbsp; Verse 23, 25.</p>
<p>Would to God there were no occasion to apply the following
charge to ourselves!&nbsp; &ldquo;Thou hast stricken them, but
they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have
refused to receive correction; they have made their faces harder
than a rock; they have refused to return.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jer. v.
3.&nbsp; Whether this scripture is not fulfilled in this day, let
facts declare.&nbsp; We have been for some years involved in all
the horrors of war.&nbsp; The desolations of it are continually
upon the increase.&nbsp; Our enemies are multiplied; and with
them our dangers too.&nbsp; Four great powers are uniting their
force against us; and we have not one single ally in Europe, that
we can call our own.&nbsp; The conjuncture of our affairs is more
and more critical; especially if we consider, that an intestine
faction still secretly works in the bosom of the state, and
labors hard to kindle and keep alive the expiring flame of
discord and rebellion.&nbsp; Add to this, that, through the last
year, the metropolis of the kingdom was just upon the point of
destruction; and with it the wealth and power of the
nation.&nbsp; These are loud calls; alarming visitations.&nbsp;
The rod hath spoken again and again; yet how few hear its voice,
<a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>or fear
him that appointed it!&nbsp; The rich and poor amongst us go on
as usual.&nbsp; Iniquity stalks with brazen front through our
streets; and error, in ten thousand forms, vents its unsoftened
blasphemies against God and his Messiah.&nbsp; Places of
amusement are crowded; and the whirl of dissipation goes on, as
if there were nothing to solemnize us, or make us think.&nbsp;
Multitudes of our gentry are laughing, at the play-house, or
pursuing a more childish farce at the masquerade, while their
poor countrymen are groaning in the field of battle, and, at the
expense of their blood and lives, are fighting for that which is
to keep others in ease and idleness.&nbsp; Thus, while the
deepest tragedy is exhibited beyond the Atlantic, on this side
the water we are carrying on the grossest farce.&nbsp; Youth are
educated in ignorance, or trained up in fashionable vice; by
which they fall an easy prey to the first bold invader of their
morals and their virtue.&nbsp; Dress, visiting, and various
species of dissipation, leave no time for the serious calls of
religion; and a knowledge of the truths of revelation forms, in
the system of many, no part of modern education.&nbsp; Frothy and
lascivious novels occupy the place of God&rsquo;s word; and there
is no book so little read or understood, as the <i>Book of
books</i>.&nbsp; The aged lead the way in folly and vanity; and
<a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>endeavour to initiate their tender offspring, as early
as possible, in those &ldquo;pomps and vanities of a wicked
world,&rdquo; which both promised to renounce.&nbsp; Thus grey
hairs give a sanction to evils, which youth want a curb in the
pursuit of.&nbsp; And thus many a child has to curse its parent
for an initiation into the pride of life and lusts of the flesh,
by which his disgrace and ruin have been led on by a sort of
necessary gradation.&nbsp; An introduction to the world, that is,
to its nonsense, vanity, and dissipation&mdash;is deemed, with
many, an essential in good-breeding.&nbsp; And, with many, to
keep <i>good</i> company, is not to associate with those who fear
God, but with those, who are distinguished by no other excellence
but the possession of a title or a fortune.&nbsp; These
accidental acquisitions are often complimented with the
appellation of <i>good</i>; though all beside should be nothing
but a compound of wretchedness and vice.&nbsp; Thus no
distinction is made between men and their accidents; and
adulation frequently offered at the shrine of debauchery and
pride.&nbsp; And thus men confound the names of good and evil;
put darkness for light, and light for darkness.</p>
<p>And can it be said that God&rsquo;s desolations have taught us
the evil of sin?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; While vice maintains its wonted
vigor, pleasure attracts its votaries as usual, and profaneness
rears <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>its triumphant crest without control or shame, it can
never be said, that we are advancing in reformation.&nbsp;
Rather, as our visitations have increased, the stupefaction of
sinners has increased with them.&nbsp; The storms, which should
rouse, have eventually rocked them to rest.&nbsp; Even the
<i>deaf adder</i> is quick of hearing, when compared with
numbers, who neglect or refuse to hear that
&ldquo;Charmer,&rdquo; whose voice, in his <i>promises</i>, is
sweeter and more harmonious than all the choristers of heaven;
and, in his <i>threatenings</i>, more tremendous than the roaring
of the seas, and all the artillery of conflicting elements.&nbsp;
Which leads me to observe, that,</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">God&rsquo;s</span> desolations in
the earth should impress us with a reverential awe of his majesty
and a dread of his wrath; should make us see his hand and
acknowledge his interposition in every event.</p>
<p>As it is the part of bad divinity to make as little as
possible of the Lord Jesus Christ, so it is the province of bad
philosophy to leave God out of its favorite systems.&nbsp; In the
latter case recourse is had to the doctrine of second causes, and
to what are called the laws of nature.&nbsp; Upon this principle,
vain man would attempt to <i>account</i> for every thing, and to
exclude all mystery from the natural and spiritual world;
although, in both respects, the phenomena exhibited evince <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>the vanity
and danger of the effort, and prove that, &ldquo;as the heavens
are higher than the earth, so are God&rsquo;s ways above our
ways, and his thoughts above our thoughts.&rdquo;&nbsp; But,
still proud man cannot bear that his reason should be confounded,
or his understanding limited; and sooner than confess his
ignorance, will explore depths, which angels cannot fathom, and
soar so high into the regions of speculation, as to drop into
materialism, and lose sight of his God.&nbsp; Thus it appears,
that from pride springs every atheistical hypothesis, that
produces a contempt of God and a denial of his sovereign
interposition; but that the very first step in that heavenly
science, which revelation styles &ldquo;the wisdom from
above,&rdquo; is humility, which makes a man submit to be taught
by his Maker, and not dispute away the existence of what he
cannot comprehend.</p>
<p>The system of nature, it is allowed, is a chain of second
causes, concatenated in such a manner, as to make one link depend
upon another by a necessary coherence.&nbsp; But second causes
must have a first, and laws must originate in some
law-giver.&nbsp; So that, admitting that nature is regulated by
certain laws interwoven with its existence and constitution,
still the contrivance and execution of the wondrous plan force us
to acknowledge, that an infinite <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>mind must have tied together at
first every link in the golden chain; and that what heathenism
called the <i>anima mundi</i>, is in reality the all-pervading,
all-supporting, and all-comprehending presence and power of
Deity.&nbsp; But what shall we say, when the laws of nature
suffer a temporary infringement?&nbsp; When the regularity of her
course is diverted, and broken in upon?&nbsp; Do the convulsions
of the earth, and the rage of elements, form any part of her
laws, or any link in the concatenation of her parts?&nbsp; Was it
by any inherent law, that the ocean once burst its barriers and
overspread the earth? that the ground opened and swallowed Korah
and his sacrilegious associates? that Sinai&rsquo;s base shook,
while its summit was enveloped with &ldquo;blackness, and
darkness, and tempest?&rdquo; that the sun was eclipsed without
any intervening sphere, and the rocks were rent, when Jesus
expired on the cross?&nbsp; Or upon what principle will
philosophy account for that final conflagration, which shall, in
the destined period, burn up the earth and the works that are
therein? when</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The cloud-capp&rsquo;d tow&rsquo;rs, the
gorgeous palaces,<br />
The solemn temples, the great Globe itself<br />
Shall dissolve; and, like the baseless fabric<br />
Of a vision, leave not a wreck behind!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are these nature&rsquo;s <i>laws</i>?&nbsp; No; they are the
disruption of them&mdash;the rending, not the order <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>of the
system.&nbsp; Who breaks in upon this harmony?&nbsp; The God of
nature.&nbsp; The Creator is the dissolver of the world.&nbsp; He
who spoke it from chaos into light and arrangement, speaks it
into ruin.&nbsp; And those who insinuate, that &ldquo;all things
continue as they were from the beginning of the world,&rdquo; an
inspired apostle calls, &ldquo;<i>scoffers</i>, who walk after
their own lusts.&nbsp; For this they willingly are ignorant of,
that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth
standing out of the water and in the water; whereby the world
that then was, being overflowed with water, perished.&nbsp; But,
the heavens and earth which are now, by the same word, kept in
store, are reserved unto fire against the day of
judgment.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2 Pet. iii. 4, 7.</p>
<p>As, therefore, there is a Supreme Being, that made and now
supporteth the world, so there is a God that <i>judgeth</i> the
earth.&nbsp; And as the world could not have existed in the
beginning without his <i>fiat</i>, so neither can the course of
nature be disturbed without his interposition.&nbsp; And they who
are so ready upon every occasion to ascribe to second causes
merely, what must be the effect of the great <span
class="smcap">First Cause</span>, indirectly strike at the
existence of <i>sin</i>, and the being of God.&nbsp; Leaving,
therefore, the vain philosopher and cavilling sceptic to
speculate about the natural causes of earthquakes, tempests,
pestilences, famine, sword; come, behold <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>the works
of the Lord, what desolations <span class="smcap">He</span> hath
made in the earth.&nbsp; For thus saith Jehovah, &ldquo;I form
light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil.&nbsp;
I the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> do <i>all these
things</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isa. xlv. 7.&nbsp; If the earth be
convulsed, Jehovah shakes it.&nbsp; If the sword rages, <i>He</i>
&ldquo;gives it its charge.&rdquo;&nbsp; If the tempest lours,
and the heavens are clothed with black, <i>He</i> guides the
storm, and rides upon the wings of the wind.&nbsp; If the
artillery of the skies send out their voice, and shoot their
arrows, it is <i>He</i>, who maketh the thunder and darts the
lightening.&nbsp; If Jerusalem is to be buried in ruins, it is
because <i>He</i> saith, &ldquo;This is the city to be
visited.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jer. vi. 6.</p>
<p>Let all the earth stand in awe of Him, and all its inhabitants
revere his majesty and dread his indignation.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
measured the waters in the hollow of his hand; he meted out
heaven with a span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a
measure, and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a
balance.&nbsp; Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and
are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold he taketh up
the isles as a very little thing.&nbsp; All nations before him
are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing,
and vanity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isa. xl. 12, 15, 17.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold
the name of the Lord cometh from far, burning <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>with his
anger, and the burden thereof is heavy; his lips are full of
indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Isa. xxx. 27.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he whet his glittering sword, and
his hand take hold on judgment, he will render vengeance to his
enemies, and will reward them that hate him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Deut.
xxxii. 41.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fear ye not <span
class="GutSmall">ME</span>? saith the Lord.&nbsp; Will ye not
tremble at my presence?&rdquo;&nbsp; Jer. v. 22.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the
fierceness of his anger?&nbsp; His fury is poured out like fire,
and the rocks are thrown down by him.&nbsp; The mountains quake
at him, and the hills melt and the earth is burned at his
presence, yea the world, and all that dwell therein.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Nah. i. 5, 6.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He frowns, and darkness veils the moon,<br
/>
The fainting sun grows dim at noon;<br />
The pillars of heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s starry roof<br />
Tremble and start at his reproof!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These sublime passages taken from the inspired writings, and
descriptive of the wisdom, majesty, grandeur, and indignation of
<span class="smcap">God</span>, are written, that we might form a
due estimate of the littleness and impotence of that reptile man,
when contending with Omnipotence? and learn from the desolations
of the earth, to tremble at his presence.&nbsp; But where are the
people that <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>have learned this lesson?&nbsp; If a veneration for the
institutions of Heaven, a delight in the ways of God, a reverent
mention of his sacred name, a conscientious observation of the
Sabbath, and a hatred of sin, be characteristics of God&rsquo;s
peculiar people, I fear the number will be found very small, when
compared with the bulk of the profane.&nbsp; And here I cannot
paint in stronger colors the prevalence of immorality in the
present day, than by adopting the words of good Bishop Sherlock,
in his description of the predominant wickedness of his own
times.&nbsp; In a sermon delivered at Salisbury, the good bishop
says, &ldquo;Surely the Gospel of Jesus Christ was never treated
with greater malice and contempt by <i>Jews</i> or
<i>Heathens</i>, than it has been in this Christian
country.&mdash;Is not Sunday become a day of diversion to great
ones, and a day of idleness to little ones?&nbsp; And has not
this been followed by a great increase of great wickedness among
the lower sort of people?&rdquo;&nbsp; And, when speaking of the
licentiousness of that period, which succeeded the Restoration,
and opened flood-gates of iniquity, which have continued through
similar channels ever since; he says, &ldquo;The sense of
religion decayed, and the very appearances of it were suspected
as a remnant of hypocrisy.&nbsp; And, if we may judge by the
<i>performances of the stage</i>, which are formed to the
<i>taste</i> of the people, <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>there never was a time when
<i>lewdness</i>, <i>irreligion</i>, and <i>profaneness</i>, were
heard with more patience.&rdquo;&nbsp; No wonder that, from a
contempt of the gospel, and a love of dissipation, should spring
what the good Bishop asserts in his Pastoral Letter, p. 7,
&ldquo;Blasphemy and horrid imprecations domineer in our streets;
and poor wretches are every hour wantonly and wickedly calling
for damnation on themselves and others, which may be, it is to be
feared, too near them already.&nbsp; Add to this, the lewdness
and debauchery that prevail among the lowest people; which keep
them idle, poor, and miserable, and the number of <i>lewd
houses</i> which trade in their vices, and must be paid for
making sin convenient to them; and it will account for villanies
of other kinds.&nbsp; For where is the wonder, that persons so
abandoned should be ready to commit all sorts of outrage and
violence.&nbsp; A <span class="GutSmall">CITY WITHOUT RELIGION
CAN NEVER BE A SAFE PLACE TO DWELL IN</span>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation234"></a><a href="#footnote234"
class="citation">[234]</a></p>
<p>Thus the excellent prelate, like a faithful watchman, lifted
up his voice like a trumpet, and dared to <i>speak out</i>.&nbsp;
And should not the ministers of the present day copy the
example?&nbsp; The lion hath roared, who will not fear?&nbsp; The
<a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>Lord God
hath spoken, who can but prophesy?&nbsp; O ye ambassadors of
Christ, &ldquo;cry aloud and spare not,&rdquo; that sinners may
take the alarm, and fly from impending judgments and imminent
destruction, to that way of salvation revealed in the
gospel.&nbsp; And this suggestion points to another improvement
to be derived from a view of God&rsquo;s desolating
dispensations; namely,</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The necessity and importance of an interest in the
blessed <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, as the great antidote
against every calamity, and the glorious security against sin and
its consequences.</p>
<p>Of all the symptoms of false security, which mark the
complexion of the present day, there is none more truly alarming,
than the supine indifference about truth, and the sovereign
contempt of the gospel, which prevail amongst us.&nbsp; Our times
are distinguished by much free thinking; and I wish there was no
cause to add, by much free blaspheming too.&nbsp; I mean not here
to insinuate any thing derogatory from that liberty which every
rational being indisputably claims of thinking, and judging for
himself, in the investigation of truth; provided always that he
make the scriptures the ground and guide of his researches.&nbsp;
Freedom of inquiry has ever proved friendly to the cause of
truth, and inimical to that of ignorance and superstition.&nbsp;
<a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>But,
when this liberty is abused, as penal shackles are taken off, it
looks as if men only wanted an easy opportunity of setting up for
system-makers, to draw after them a gaping multitude, and make
them stare at these prodigies in theology, who profess to suit
their tenets to the taste of all.&nbsp; Hence, some make
liturgies, and omit all divine homage to Him, whom the scriptures
command us &ldquo;to honor even as we honor the
Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; This appears a bright discovery to others,
who immediately take the hint, and frame a manual upon a broader
plan; in which the name of Jesus Christ is not so much as
<i>mentioned</i>.&nbsp; A compliment this to the Deists, who are
very much enraged at the idea of making a crucified man the
centre of any system, or the object of any divine honors.&nbsp;
But a third, still more hugely catholic, steps forward, and
proposes a more enlarged plan, in which Jews, Turks, and the
worshippers of Jupiter Ammon, may be blended together in one
common brotherhood with believers in Jesus Christ; and a way to
happiness be secured for Julian the Apostate, as well as Paul the
Apostle.&nbsp; This is free-thinking with a witness.&nbsp; But,
would such persons think as closely and calmly, as they think
freely, the desolating judgments of God might teach them, that
the Jewish nation could not practise idolatry <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>without
suffering severely for it; and that rejection of the Messiah, and
contempt of his gospel, were the aggravated sins that reduced
their city and temple to ashes, and themselves to the abject
state of vagabonds on the earth.</p>
<p>If there be any one truth, which appears more prominent than
all the rest in the sacred scriptures, it is, that &ldquo;other
foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus
Christ;&rdquo;&mdash;that he is our &ldquo;wisdom, righteousness,
sanctification, and redemption;&rdquo;&mdash;that &ldquo;there is
none other name under heaven whereby we can be
saved;&rdquo;&mdash;that he is &ldquo;set forth as a propitiation
through faith in his blood;&rdquo;&mdash;that he &ldquo;offered
himself a <i>sacrifice</i> to God, and died to <i>put away
sin</i> by the sacrifice of himself;&rdquo;&mdash;that not our
works, but his work, is to be the ground of our acceptance, since
&ldquo;we are accepted <i>in</i> the beloved;&rdquo; and that, to
stamp sufficiency on his glorious salvation, &ldquo;in him dwelt
all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet how
little do these truths enter into popular systems!&nbsp; Is there
any question that would appear more difficult to many professors
of Christianity to be solved, than, &ldquo;What think ye of
Christ?&rdquo;&nbsp; But while the infidel sports with truth, and
the careless contemn its admonitions, O let us give diligence to
make our calling and election sure.&nbsp; Let us fly to him, <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>to whom all
the nations of the earth are commanded to look and be
saved.&nbsp; Would we be secure from the guilt of sin, or armed
against the sting of death, let us betake ourselves to him, who
bore the one and conquered the other, by dying himself.&nbsp;
Would we be prepared for whatever afflictions may befall us as
individuals, or judgments overtake us as a nation; let us but
build our hope upon the rock of ages, and then all shall work for
good.&nbsp; If Christ be ours, then whether wrath is revealed or
judgments impend, we shall have a secure shelter in his blood and
righteousness.&nbsp; The earth may be removed, and the mountains
cast into the midst of the sea; yet, in the midst of
nature&rsquo;s wreck, we shall sing, &ldquo;The Lord of Hosts is
with us, the God of Jacob is our refuge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; We should view even the desolations of the earth as
an accessory ground of joy and confidence in God.&nbsp; When
Martin Luther and his associates in reformation were in any
trouble, he used often to say, &ldquo;Come let us sing the 46th
Psalm.&rdquo;&nbsp; With the words of this sweet composition in
his mouth, and the energetic power of it in his heart, he
animated himself and his companions in tribulation.&nbsp; When
any storms arose within, the subject of the psalm dispelled them,
and, like the melody of David&rsquo;s harp, soothing to rest the
turbulent spirit of <a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>Saul, calmed their fears, and
enabled them to sing their troubles away.&nbsp; We should imitate
the heroic spirit of these champions in the cause of truth; for
we have the same reason to rejoice that they had.&nbsp; If the
Lord be our God, we should trust in him and not be afraid.&nbsp;
He never gives up that tender relation towards his people, amidst
any troubles that may arise.&nbsp; Though he desolate the earth
with the most fearful judgments, yet he is the Father of his
chosen still.&nbsp; And when this globe shall be in flames, Jesus
will collect his jewels, and preserve them from ruin.&nbsp;
Therefore, in the words of Habakkuk, &ldquo;Although the fig-tree
shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be in the vines; the
labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no
meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall
be no herd in the stalls; yet let us rejoice in the Lord, let us
joy in the God of our salvation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hab. iii. 17,
18.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">THE NATURE
AND DISTINGUISHING MARKS OF TRUE CONVERSION.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">[Preached at Nantwich, December
8th, 1782.]</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Except ye be converted</i>, <i>and
become as little children</i>, <i>ye shall not enter into the
kingdom of heaven</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Matthew</span>,
xviii. 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> blessed Saviour uttered these
words upon the following memorable occasion:&mdash;The disciples
came unto Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Who is the greatest in the
kingdom of heaven?&rdquo; verse 1.&nbsp; Upon comparing this with
the parallel place in Mark, ix. 34, it appears, that &ldquo;they
had been disputing among themselves, who should be the
greatest.&rdquo;&nbsp; A dispute this, extremely unprofitable,
and highly unbecoming the disciples of that meek and lowly Jesus,
who, though he thought it no robbery to be equal with God, yet
took upon him the form of a servant, and <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>came not to
be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a
ransom for many.&nbsp; Phil. ii. 6, 7.&nbsp; Mat. xx. 28.&nbsp;
But see how deeply the love of power, and a fondness for
pre-eminence, are rooted in human nature!&nbsp; One would have
thought, that with such an illustrious example of humility and
condescension before their eyes as their divine Master,
<i>they</i> should have been the last men in the world to
commence a contest about greatness; especially if they at all
reflected, that the uniform obscurity of their origin and
education placed them all upon a level.&nbsp; But when we behold
pride creeping into the little college of our Lord&rsquo;s own
disciples, and see a company of illiterate fishermen urging a
controversy about superiority in office, we may from hence infer,
that &ldquo;to be as gods,&rdquo; Gen. iii. 5, is a desire as
predominant in the nature of man as it proved fatal to our first
parents; that every man is born a Diotrephes,&mdash;would have
the pre-eminence in all things; and that the same arrogant
spirit, which lifts up a Roman pontiff with pride and blasphemy,
is congenial to human nature; and that there is that in every
man&rsquo;s heart, which would incline him to be a little pope in
pre-eminence, how low soever his pretensions may be, or
contracted his sphere of action.</p>
<p><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>What
led to the dispute among the disciples, was, probably, the
mistaken notion they had conceived respecting the nature of the
Messiah&rsquo;s kingdom.&nbsp; Fancying that it was to be a
secular establishment, and having their heads full of ideas of
their own future greatness, it should seem that they anticipated
the period of their exaltation; and, concluding, that they should
be raised to the highest posts of civil and ecclesiastical
preferment, it remained only for them to determine, who among
them should be chief.&nbsp; For genuine pride can never brook a
superior; and is never perfectly gratified, until every
competitor is vanquished, and its own sovereign mandates acquire
a sanction from a pre-eminence of office and power.&nbsp; The
source this, of all the fierce contentions, that have often for
centuries rent the church, and are at this day ravaging the
world.&nbsp; The unsanctified disputes of ecclesiastical rulers,
or the bloody contests among the tyrannical governors of states
and empires, when narrowly examined, appear to originate, for the
most part, in this question, &ldquo;Who shall be
greatest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to strike at the root of this imperious disposition
in his disciples, their wise Master gave such an answer to their
question, as would best tend to mortify their vanity, and <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>disappoint
their affectation of false greatness.&nbsp; To give an emphasis
to his observations on this important question, he took a child,
and placed him in the midst of them, and then pronounced the
great and interesting truth of the text.&nbsp; As if our Lord
should say, &ldquo;Imagine not that my kingdom, as to its origin
and establishment, is of this world.&nbsp; It is entirely
spiritual; is not to be founded on secular dominion, or to be
conducted agreeably to the principles and temper of earthly
potentates.&nbsp; And whereas, among men, human greatness is
estimated by worldly exaltation; and they are generally deemed
the chief, who rise to the highest post of honor, though avarice,
pride, and ambition, are the mischievous tempers that lead to
their exaltation, and are fed by the enjoyment of it; yet it
shall not be so in the kingdom which I am about to establish in
the hearts of the children of men.&nbsp; There, ambition is to
have for its object, not earth, but heaven; not temporal, but
eternal concerns: and the laws by which the subjects of that
kingdom are to be governed, will require, not the temper of the
proud and the ambitious, that is so successful in the schemes of
the men of the world, but the disposition of a child, humble,
teachable, dead to the world, and dependant upon me for every
provision.&nbsp; And except ye be inwardly changed, <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>and become
transformed into this amiable and heavenly characteristic of the
subjects of my kingdom, ye cannot be partakers of my
glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the words, thus opened, I shall take occasion to
consider; <i>First</i>, The nature of conversion;
<i>Secondly</i>, The temper that distinguishes this great change;
<i>Thirdly</i>, I shall endeavour to shew, how much every
individual among us is concerned in the subject, since our Lord
declares, that, without conversion, we shall not enter into the
kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; As to the nature of conversion, it essentially
consists in an inward and universal change of heart, wrought by
the gracious operation of the Spirit of God; by which new
principles are established in the mind, new inclinations are
imparted, and new objects pursued.&nbsp; The word conversion
signifies the being turned away from an object of former
attachment, in order to contemplate and enjoy one, that had been
previously disregarded and despised.&nbsp; In the work, which
this word is adapted to describe, there occurs this twofold
change.&nbsp; The heart is turned away from the love of sin, the
love of self, and the love of the world, and becomes captivated
with the love of God, and turns to him as its chief good.&nbsp;
Sin loses its dominion, the world appears in its true colors,
stript of all that false beauty, in which a depraved heart is <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>apt to
paint it.&nbsp; Pleasure, that fatal enchantress, can allure no
longer.&nbsp; She spreads all her nets, and gilds all her baits,
in vain.&nbsp; The converted sinner perceives no melody in her
syren voice, and feels no attraction from all her studied
blandishments.&nbsp; Conversion removes the scales from his eyes,
and rends the veil from his heart, that prevented him from seeing
through the false disguise that covered all her lying
vanities.&nbsp; And he turns away with disgust and disappointment
from that cup, of which he once drank so freely.&nbsp; He
nauseates what he once imbibed so eagerly; and in that draught,
from which he once hoped to derive such happiness, he now sees
poison and death concealed.&nbsp; The love of God having
vanquished the love of the world in his heart, he now heartily
coincides with that wise man, whose experience taught him, that
&ldquo;all is vanity and vexation of spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Eccles.
i. 14.</p>
<p>As it is a very common case for one, who has been a
profligate, to commence Pharisee, or to turn from sin to self,
which is but a refined species of wickedness; it is necessary to
observe, that in the great change of which the Holy Spirit is the
author, it is the principal office of that divine Agent, to
convince of sin, and to drive the sinner from the false refuge of
self-dependance, to the glorious righteousness <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>of the Lord
Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Without this, a sinner would take down one
idol only to set up a worse in its stead.&nbsp; And, as there is
none so injurious to the honor of the Redeemer, or so deeply
prejudicial to a sinner&rsquo;s immortal interests, as
self-righteousness; this idol, as the leader of all the rest,
must be dethroned, that Christ might have in all things the
pre-eminence.&nbsp; &ldquo;In <i>him</i> shall all the seed of
Israel be justified.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isa. xlv. 25.&nbsp; When a man,
therefore, is truly converted, the Holy Spirit never teaches him
to turn in upon himself, and contemplate with proud
self-complacency his own worthiness, or to admire his own
performances; while, like the Pharisee in the gospel, he looks
down with conscious superiority upon a poor publican at the
footstool of mercy.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; With Job, he abhors himself,
and repents as in dust and ashes.&nbsp; Job, xiii. 6.&nbsp; With
Isaiah, he cries, &ldquo;Woe is me! for I am undone.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Isa. vi. 5.&nbsp; And, with St. Paul, he desires to &ldquo;be
found in Christ, not having on his own righteousness, which is of
the law, but the righteousness of God by faith.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Phil. iii. 9.&nbsp; So that, as naturalists say, it is the
peculiarity of the heliotrope or sun-flower to expand its
beauties to the rays of the sun, and always to keep its face
turned towards that bright luminary; in like manner, the
converted soul spontaneously turns to the Sun of Righteousness,
<a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>by the
light of whose countenance it is cheered and attracted, and to
whose merits it is indebted for all its prospects in time and
eternity.&nbsp; The love of Jesus is the load-stone that draws,
and his perfect righteousness the object which the happy sinner
contemplates with delight and admiration.&nbsp; To that
exhaustless spring of all the hopes and comforts of God&rsquo;s
people he turns, and from him he looks for wisdom, righteousness,
sanctification, and redemption.&nbsp; 1 Cor. i. 30.</p>
<p>Where conversion is genuine, it may be discovered by the
universality of its influence, and the depth of its
operation.&nbsp; It begins at the heart, and extends its salutary
effects to all the sublime faculties of the mind, and the whole
tenor of the outward conversation.&nbsp; The understanding is
renewed in knowledge.&nbsp; Col. iii. 10.&nbsp; The contrariety
of the will is broken, and is changed into a passive acquiescence
in the sovereign will of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;The carnal mind, which
is enmity against God,&rdquo; Rom. viii. 7, is subdued by the
superior influence of divine grace.&nbsp; All offences at the
gospel-plan of salvation cease; for, when the veil of unbelief
that covers the heart is rent, it then &ldquo;turns to the
Lord.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2 Cor. iii. 15.&nbsp; The languid affections
are quickened, and are set on things above.&nbsp; Col. iii.
1.&nbsp; The desires are turned into <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>a right channel, and directed to
proper objects.&nbsp; The eye of the understanding being
illuminated to &ldquo;behold as in a glass the glory of the Lord
Jesus,&rdquo; 2 Cor. iii. 18; the heart, enraptured with a view
of his matchless excellency, cries out, &ldquo;Whom have I in
heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth, that I desire
besides thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. lxxiii. 25.&nbsp; The desire of
the soul is to him, and to the remembrance of his great name and
glorious salvation.&nbsp; Isa. xxvi. 8.&nbsp; The thoughts, that
formerly wandered upon subjects of the most trivial, or the most
pernicious nature, are now turned to the interesting concerns of
eternity, and are often employed in meditating upon that
sweetest, most sublime, and most copious of all topics, the
stupendous love of God manifested in the unspeakable gift of the
Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The strain of conversation becomes very
materially altered, from froth and levity, or, what is worse,
from perhaps indecency and gross profaneness, to seriousness,
purity, and spirituality.&nbsp; The aversion to engage in
religious converse ceases; and no company appears so honorable or
so delightful, as that which is composed of persons, who love to
talk of the great things that belong to their peace.&nbsp; Prayer
is deemed an exalted privilege, as well as a duty; and praise is
considered as the employ of heaven.&nbsp; The hands are lifted
up, and the <a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>knee is bent in supplication before the divine throne;
and the tongue, which is the glory of man, awakes to vindicate
the honor of truth, to recommend the Friend of sinners, or to
publish the preciousness of his salvation.&nbsp; The feet, turned
away from crooked and perverse ways, are swift to bear the
converted sinner to the house of God; where, as he sits rejoicing
in the name of Jesus, and happy in the sound of that blessed
gospel, that charms his ear, and captivates his heart, he joins
issue with the sweet Psalmist of Israel, and says, &ldquo;How
amiable are thy dwellings, thou Lord of Hosts!&nbsp; One day in
thy courts is better than a thousand.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. lxxxiv.
l, 10.</p>
<p>It has been suggested in the beginning of this head of the
discourse, that to turn the heart of a sinner is the work of
God.&nbsp; And most certainly, whatever conversion is, the
scriptures authorize us to believe, that it is not the work of
man; and indeed cannot be, since the extreme depravity and
helplessness of his nature render him altogether insufficient to
any good word or work.&nbsp; If conversion consisted in nothing
more than the breaking off some outwardly vicious courses, or the
mere adopting a line of regular attendance on the external forms
of devotion; if it implied no more than decency of manners, and
an exemption <a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>from gross indulgencies, or the relinquishing of former
excesses; in those cases, perhaps, man might exert his power with
considerable success, and, in part at least, claim the honor of
being instrumental to his own salvation.&nbsp; But as conversion
hath, for its subject, the immortal soul, with all its strong
propensities, intemperate desires, irregular passions, impetuous
appetites, and depraved principles; as it comprehends a work that
gets at the very root of sin, and cleanses the fountain of
corruption, that renovates the very constituent faculties of the
human mind, and forms a radical cure in the very centre and seat
of the malady; it is evident, that the change necessary to
produce this effect must be the result of a divine agency; or, in
plainer terms, that <span class="smcap">He</span> who made the
heart, and <span class="smcap">He</span> alone, can change
it.&nbsp; A truth this, confirmed by the express authority of the
word of God.&nbsp; &ldquo;Without me,&rdquo; says Christ,
&ldquo;ye can do nothing.&rdquo;&nbsp; John, xv. 5.&nbsp; And he
says again, &ldquo;No man <i>can</i> come unto me, except the
Father which hath sent me, <i>draw</i> him.&rdquo;&nbsp; John,
vi. 44.&nbsp; In that solemn prayer uttered by the church in her
distress, and recorded in the lamentations of Jeremiah, she
acknowledges the same truth, when she cries, &ldquo;Turn <span
class="GutSmall">THOU</span> us unto thee O Lord, and we
<i>shall</i> be turned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lam. v. 21.&nbsp; <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>And this is
the language of Ephraim bemoaning himself in Jer. xxxi. 18.&nbsp;
Where, after having bewailed the refractoriness of his heart,
that made him feel, under the discipline of Jehovah&rsquo;s rod,
like &ldquo;a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke,&rdquo; he cries
out, &ldquo;Turn <span class="GutSmall">THOU</span> me and I
shall be turned.&rdquo;&nbsp; And when the great change was
effected, in retrospect, as before in prospect, he attributes the
accomplishment of it to the power of God, saying, &ldquo;Surely,
after that I <span class="GutSmall">WAS TURNED</span>, I
repented,&rdquo; &amp;c. verse 19.&nbsp; And, indeed, the passive
form of the words of the text fully implies the truth I am
contending for, especially when compared with similar language in
Acts, iii. 19.&nbsp; Psal. li. 13.&nbsp; As for those passages of
scripture, which seem to make the power of turning to be the
sinner&rsquo;s sole act, or to rest in the efforts of the
ministers of the gospel, as Ezek. xiv. 6. and Mal. iv. 6. Acts,
xxvi. 18. they are to be interpreted, in consistency with the
general maxim already laid down, as only declarative in one case,
of the <i>instrumentality</i>, which divine wisdom useth in the
accomplishment of its purposes; and, in the other, of the derived
influence, which the sinner himself is enabled to exert, but by a
power, originally not his own.&nbsp; Thus, ministers are said to
turn others from darkness to light, and sinners to turn
themselves, only in consequence of the <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>blessing
and power of God, which enable them to do the one and the other
respectively.&nbsp; For, when the great Apostle of the Gentiles
reviewed the success of his ministrations, or when he
contemplated the evidences of his conversion, he resolves both
into the agency and sovereignty of divine grace, saying,
&ldquo;Not I, but the grace of God which was with me.&mdash;By
the grace of God I am what I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Cor. xv. 10.</p>
<p>I cannot prevail upon myself to dismiss this branch of the
subject, without observing further, in confirmation of what hath
been already urged, that the change effected in the conversion of
a sinner, is compared, in scripture, to some of those operations
in nature, to accomplish which nothing short of an Almighty
agency is requisite.&nbsp; It is, for instance, called &ldquo;a
new <i>creation</i>,&rdquo; 2 Cor. v. 17;&mdash;a new
<i>birth</i>, John, iii. 3;&mdash;a <i>resurrection</i> from the
dead, Col. iii. 1;&mdash;a quickening from a death in trespasses
and sins, Ephes. ii. 1;&mdash;the communication of light to the
soul, by the same powerful voice that said in the beginning,
&ldquo;Let there be light.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2 Cor. iv. 6;&mdash;a
translation from the kingdom of Satan into the kingdom of
God&rsquo;s dear Son.&nbsp; Col. i. 13.&nbsp; And the renovation
which it produceth, is said to make believers &ldquo;the
habitation of God by his spirit,&rdquo; Ephes. ii.
22;&mdash;&ldquo;his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>good
works,&rdquo; Ephes. ii. 10;&mdash;branches, taken from a barren
stock, and engrafted into the &ldquo;true vine&rdquo; by the
operation of the Spirit, John, xv. 5;&mdash;sons of God by
adoption, Gal. iv. 6;&mdash;and joint-heirs with Christ to an
everlasting inheritance, purchased at the price of his blood.</p>
<p>Now, from such bold and striking metaphors, as make the power
that created the universe, that arranged the elements when in a
state of chaos, that formed the light, and that raised the dead,
to be representative of that influence exerted in conversion,
what are we to infer? but that, as an omnipotent agency is
displayed in the works of nature, it is equally requisite in the
operations of grace; and, in fact, that none but <span
class="smcap">He</span> who made the world, can convert a
sinner.&nbsp; A truth this, to which the experience of every true
believer bears an additional testimony.&nbsp; Reviewing himself
as a brand plucked from the burnings, he cannot but stand
astonished at the mighty power of that grace, which saved him
from eternal perdition, when he was just upon its very
brink.&nbsp; &ldquo;How infinitely indebted,&rdquo; he will often
say, &ldquo;do I consider myself to that gracious Saviour, whose
mercy vanquished such a rebel! and whose blood was sufficient to
expiate the guilt of such deep-dyed transgressions!&nbsp; When I
reflect, with what impetuosity <a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>I was running in the road to ruin;
with what obduracy of heart I defied Omnipotence, while I was
trampling his law under my feet, and lived regardless either of
his threatenings or his promises; what a contumacious resistance
I made to all the overtures of divine mercy in the gospel, and
with what blindness, unbelief, and hardness of heart, I
quarrelled with the way of salvation through a crucified Saviour;
in what a false security I was wrapt up, even when my headstrong
corruptions were precipitating me to destruction; and how
determined I was never to relinquish the fond but fatal
prepossessions that only fed the pride of my heart, and kept it
in a state of servile conformity to a world lying in
wickedness;&mdash;when I revolve all these considerations in my
mind, I rejoice with trembling, to think, how narrowly I escaped;
and am constrained to attribute all to the sovereign and unsought
interposition of divine grace.&nbsp; Surely nothing but a
supernatural power could have softened a heart so hard as mine;
and none but God himself could have saved a sinner so
rebellious.&nbsp; Therefore, while life, and breath, and being,
last, to <span class="smcap">Him</span> I will offer up the
glowing effusions of love and gratitude, and record through
eternity what he hath done for my soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>A
work of this nature, in which the hand of God is so conspicuous,
must be productive of the most salutary effects to the highly
favored sinner, who is the subject of it.&nbsp; For, &ldquo;if
any man be in Christ, he is a new creature (&eta;&rsquo;
&kappa;&alpha;&iota;&nu;&eta;
&kappa;&tau;&iota;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf; a new creation): old
things are passed away; behold all things are become
new.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2 Cor. v. 17.&nbsp; The renovation, intimated
in this passage, having introduced new light into the
understanding, and new desires into the heart and affections, it
must consequently have a proportionable effect upon the temper;
not wholly to eradicate the constitutional peculiarity of it, but
to sanctify, and render it subservient to the glory of God and
the good of society.&nbsp; Nor does this great change go merely
to correct, regulate, and sanctify the natural temper, whatever
in different constitutions it may happen to be, but it likewise
establishes in the heart tempers, to which it was before an utter
stranger; which I now proceed to consider under the second head;
and that is,</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The distinguishing mark of true conversion, that, of
&ldquo;becoming as little children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although, in numerous instances, the work of conversion is
attended with circumstances so striking as not only to obviate
all doubt respecting the reality of it, but also to enable many
to fix, with the utmost precision, the <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>date of its
origin, and to recollect perfectly the time and manner in which
the light of conviction first dawned; yet, as in others, the work
has been wrought at an early period of life, has been less
perceptible in its first impressions, and has been carried on by
degrees slow and progressive, like &ldquo;seed cast into the
ground, which springeth and groweth up, a man <i>knoweth not
how</i>;&rdquo; Mark, iv. 27.&nbsp; I prefer the consideration of
what is essential to conversion, and <i>common</i> to all the
subjects of it, to what is <i>peculiar</i> to some, and
comparatively of little consequence.&nbsp; For the point of real
moment with every sinner is, not so much to inquire how, when,
and by what instrument he was converted, as to ascertain, that
the work has really been wrought.&nbsp; And, indeed, as it is
extremely possible for a man, busy in the former inquiry, and
partial in his inferences respecting the safety of his state, to
rest the great affair on circumstances rather uncertain in their
nature, and at no time decisive, while he fatally overlooks what
is essential to the work itself; in order to set us right in a
matter of such vast concern, the text, and the whole tenor of
sacred scripture, lead us to examine, whether we are
&ldquo;become as little children;&rdquo; because this is the
safest and most certain criterion of our being the children of
God: and thus, in particular, St. Peter argues with <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>the
professors of Christianity in his day, saying, &ldquo;If these
things, (faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
godliness, brotherly kindness, charity,) be in you, and abound,
they make you, that ye shall be neither barren nor unfruitful in
the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; But he that lacketh
these things, is blind, and cannot see afar off.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2
Pet. i. 8, 9.</p>
<p>When our Lord makes the principal characteristic of true
conversion to consist in a temper resembling that of little
children, the comparison is not designed to consider them, as
they are by nature, but as they happen to be by constitution, by
the texture of their tender frame, and their accidental inability
to exercise those faculties of the mind, or those organs of the
body, which, when age and strength co-operate, man very soon uses
as instruments of unrighteousness.&nbsp; It is in this light, and
this alone, that we can interpret the force of the resemblance in
the text, consistently either with scripture or matter of
fact.&nbsp; The former assures us, that &ldquo;man is born as the
wild ass&rsquo;s colt.&rdquo;&nbsp; Job, xi. 12.&nbsp; And
experience soon demonstrates the truth of this striking
comparison, when that &ldquo;folly which is bound up in the heart
of a child,&rdquo; Prov. xxii. 15, shooteth forth into those
branches of iniquity, and fruits of unrighteousness, which, like
the flower in the seed, or the <a name="page258"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 258</span>fruit wrapt up in the germ, only
wanted time and strength to bring them to maturity.&nbsp; Yet, as
long as corruption is checked by infantile weakness, and nature
has not power, in that first stage of the life of man, to put
forth its innate propensities, infants and little children become
eventual teachers to adults; and many with hoary heads need not
be ashamed to go and learn wisdom from the weakest and youngest
of their own species; especially if they attend to the several
points of view, in which scripture places little children, as
objects worthy of our imitation.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In the first place, as they are no sooner ushered
into life, than they cry for that nutriment, which the God of
nature hath so wisely adapted to their weak condition; in like
manner, must we evidence the reality of our regeneration, by an
insatiate thirst for that spring of salvation opened in the
scriptures of truth.&nbsp; Thus the Apostle Peter says, &ldquo;As
new-born babes desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may
grow thereby.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Pet. ii. 2.&nbsp; And St. Paul uses
the same idea, when writing to the Corinthian Church, he says,
&ldquo;I have fed you with milk and not with strong
meat.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Cor. ii. 2.&nbsp; See also Heb. v. 13,
14.&nbsp; As the new-born babe, by instinct of nature, cries for
the breast, so the new-born soul first evidences its introduction
<a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>into
divine life, by its love to the scriptures.&nbsp; For this
spiritual food, other things are thrown aside; and what
constituted the soul&rsquo;s repast, when dead in sin, is, after
its regeneration, esteemed as chaff, or dreaded even as
poison.&nbsp; The midnight lamp, that had been often exhausted in
the perusal of publications of the most frothy or the most
pernicious tendency, is now extinguished, that the soul might
indulge in sweet meditation on the word of God.&nbsp; In the
streams, which flow from this fountain, there are no dregs of
latent error or poison of lurking impurity.&nbsp; And, while they
communicate life and health by their salubrious influence, they
convey also the most refined enjoyment to the renewed mind.&nbsp;
The sacred pages, like the fragrant <i>name</i>, which gives them
all their preciousness, are as &ldquo;ointment poured
forth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Solomon&rsquo;s Song, i. 3.&nbsp; They emit
an odor that regales the senses and ravishes the heart.&nbsp; The
promises are those &ldquo;breasts of consolation,&rdquo; from
whence the new-born soul derives all its nourishment; and while
it &ldquo;hears them, reads, marks, learns, and inwardly digests
them,&rdquo; <a name="citation259"></a><a href="#footnote259"
class="citation">[259]</a> its life is fed, and its happiness
enlarged.&nbsp; This made the Royal Psalmist say, &ldquo;How
sweet are <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my
mouth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. cxix. 103.&nbsp; So that they who can
delight more in frothy novels, and the pernicious productions of
the stage, than in a perusal of the word of God; or who can make
any other book whatever take the lead of the Bible, have no more
pretensions to refinement of taste, than they have to true
religion.&nbsp; And such persons need not go far to find out
whether they be converted or not; their disrelish to the
scriptures is as decisive a mark against them as possible.&nbsp;
And till their vitious taste is refined, and their depraved
nature renewed, they cannot resemble little children, according
to the idea suggested in the text, and must, therefore, be far
from the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Another sense, in which we should become as little
children, is in the imitation of their humility.&nbsp; This is
the temper more immediately recommended in the context, because
it is the direct reverse of that which led the disciples to
dispute about pre-eminence, and to ask their Lord an unimportant
and vain question.&nbsp; Whatever seeds of pride lurk in the
nature of infants, yet such is their imbecility of constitution,
that, for want of power to exert themselves, they are rather
patterns of humility; but more especially, if such little
children as our Lord referred <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>to, are partakers of the grace of
God.&nbsp; Pride shews itself in forms of various nature.&nbsp;
Elation of heart, when the sun of worldly prosperity shines, and
proportionable depression and pusillanimity, when the scene
shifts to the gloom of adversity&mdash;envy at another
man&rsquo;s good fortune, and repining at our
own&mdash;impatience of reproof, and a quick and acrimonious
resentment of injuries&mdash;an overweening desire to grasp at
worldly things, only to feed and pamper a worldly mind&mdash;a
violent promptitude to boast of personal endowments, to the
depreciating of others, and the aggrandizing of <span
class="smcap">Self</span>, that darling idol of an unhumbled
heart&mdash;are all pride, that hydra with many heads, shewing
itself in these and various other ways impossible to be
enumerated.&nbsp; But, to be humble, look at the infant lulled to
rest in his mother&rsquo;s arms, or the child taken up with the
objects of his puerile amusement, dead to the broils of the
contentious, and to all the ambitious pursuits of the proud: the
former, anxious only for that nutriment, which, when received,
operates as a pleasing opiate to its senses; the latter extending
his solicitude and ambition only to some little matter, which it
costs no care or expense to possess, leaving sceptres, titles,
riches, and honors, to those who exert all their subtlety and all
their pride to procure them.&nbsp; To be <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>thus easy,
like a little child, about worldly pre-eminence, and to be
solicitous only, or primarily, about the honor that cometh from
God, is the privilege of a Christian, and a mark of
conversion.&nbsp; And why should infatuated mortals indulge a
contrary temper, when, &ldquo;before honor is humility;&rdquo;
but especially when it is considered that the loftiest head must
be laid low in the grave, and that &ldquo;dust to dust&rdquo;
will conclude the noblest song of earth.&nbsp; If you disdain to
learn humility from a little child, yet take as your pattern that
illustrious example of condescension, the holy child Jesus, who
for us men and for our salvation exchanged the glory of the
heaven of heavens for a manger and a cross.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; We must become <i>teachable</i> as little
children.&nbsp; This amiable disposition is one principal branch
of true humility, and essentially consists in submitting our
reason to the authority of revelation.&nbsp; A point this, not so
easy to be accomplished, when we reflect on the pride of the
human heart, and see multitudes propagating such tenets, as if
they meant to teach the scriptures, and not that the scriptures
should teach them.&nbsp; This more especially happens, when the
pride of reason and the parade of learning unite their influence
to puff men up with a fond conceit of the superiority of their <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>wisdom.&nbsp; But how mortifying to the vanity of these
sons of science to hear the following declaration from the mouth
of the Son of God!&nbsp; &ldquo;I thank thee, O Father, Lord of
heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise
and prudent, and hast revealed them unto
<i>babes</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mat. xi. 25.&nbsp; Were a man
possessed of all the learning of Greece and Rome, he may,
notwithstanding, be a fool in God&rsquo;s account; and, until he
is so, in his own estimation, his profound wisdom is nothing but
foolishness, and, instead of aiding him in the investigation of
truth, often proves a dreadful bar in his way.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
any man among you seem to be wise in this world,&rdquo; says St.
Paul, &ldquo;let him become a fool, that he may be
wise.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Cor. iii. 18.&nbsp; And the reason which the
apostle urges for this extraordinary requisition, is, that
&ldquo;the wisdom of the world is foolishness with
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Verse 19.&nbsp; Conceive human nature at the
very summit of secular wisdom, and you see it elevated to the
very pinnacle of pride; from whence men find it very difficult to
descend into the valley of self-abasement.&nbsp; And yet descend
they must, if ever they would know themselves or Christ Jesus the
Lord; and instead of going to the throne of divine grace with
philosophic pride and conscious wisdom, they must approach it as
children, and as fools.</p>
<p><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 264</span>The
language of this humble temper is, &ldquo;That which I see not,
teach thou me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Job, xxxiv. 32.&mdash;&ldquo;Open
thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy
law.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. cxix. 18.&nbsp; And he who has been
enabled to adopt it, like a child under tutors and governors,
submitting to their instruction, and acquiescing in their
discipline, sits at the feet of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
to learn the mysteries of his kingdom, and receive the fulfilment
of that promise, &ldquo;It is written in the prophets, <i>And
they shall be all taught of God</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; John, vi.
45.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; As true religion is the most efficacious bond of
society, by inspiring such tempers as promote benevolence and
peace among men, St. Paul recommends the following maxim to the
church of Corinth, &ldquo;In malice <i>be ye children</i>, but in
understanding be men.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Cor. xiv. 20.&nbsp; Malice
is a deeply-rooted ill-will, accompanied with rancorous hatred,
and a thirst of revenge; a temper that rages in the hearts of
natural men, but cannot be harboured or indulged in a regenerate
breast.&nbsp; Here again we are to learn of little
children.&nbsp; If a momentary passion ruffles their temper, or
awakens their feeble resentment; yet how soon is the cause of
their indignation forgot! and in how few instances does the sun
ever go down upon their wrath!&nbsp; In the bounds which nature
hath fixed to their <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>short-lived anger, they become
examples highly worthy our imitation, that we should be
&ldquo;slow to wrath;&rdquo; James, i. 19; &ldquo;be angry and
sin not;&rdquo; Ephes. iv. 26; and that we should &ldquo;put on,
as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies,
kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;
forbearing one another, and forgiving one another; if any man
have a quarrel against any; even as Christ forgave us, so also
should we.&rdquo;&nbsp; Col. iii. 12, 13.&nbsp; But, where the
contrary tempers of studied revenge and inveterate malice
predominate, and are secretly indulged, they are as certain
evidences of the reigning dominion of sin, and of an unconverted
state of heart, as habitual drunkenness and debauchery.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; As <i>children</i> look up to their parents for their
entire provision; are indebted to them, under God, for their
being; and receive their education and their fortune from their
hands; so, to demonstrate our conversion, we must live a life of
dependance upon the Supreme Being for every thing contributory to
our comfort here, and our salvation hereafter.&nbsp; That we all
live, move, and have our being in God, is a truth admitted by
all.&nbsp; But yet, multitudes who subscribe to the doctrine,
nevertheless &ldquo;live as without God
(<i>&#7936;&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&iota; atheists</i>) in the
world;&rdquo; possessing atheistical hearts with <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>orthodox
heads; &ldquo;professing that they know God; but in works denying
him, being abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work
reprobate;&rdquo; Tit. i. 16; never heartily imploring his
blessing upon the bounties of his providence, or thanking him for
the continuance of favors, which, by their ingratitude, they are
daily forfeiting, together with the lives that his mercy so
eminently spares.&nbsp; To instil the opposite temper, of
dependance, gratitude, and confidence, our Lord sends us not only
to little children, but also to the fowls of the air, and the
flowers of the field; that, from the growth of a lily, or the
provision made by the great Father of the universe, for the young
ravens that call upon him, we may learn to live upon his
all-beneficent hand; to acknowledge his parental care; and to
trust that all-surrounding and all-protecting Providence, which
makes the hairs of our head, as well as the whole world itself,
the objects of his preserving and merciful superintendence.</p>
<p>But how much more should we learn to look up to the great
Author of redemption for our spiritual provision!&nbsp; Whatever
is necessary to the delight, the refreshment, the guidance, the
establishment, the salvation of sinners, is all laid up in the
rich fulness of the Son of God.&nbsp; If they want spiritual
repast, he is <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>the &ldquo;bread of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; If they want
consolation, he is the fountain of living waters, and the God of
all comfort.&nbsp; If they want wisdom, all the treasures of it
centre in him, and he is Wonderful, Counsellor.&nbsp; If they
want a righteousness to justify before the great Jehovah, his
name is The Lord our Righteousness.&nbsp; Jer. xxiii. 6.&nbsp; If
they want a friend to speak for them to God, to plead their
cause, and render their services acceptable, he is their Advocate
with the Father; and, for the unchangeableness of his affection,
hath in all ages proved himself a friend that sticketh closer
than a brother.&nbsp; If they want one, whose wisdom and power
are sufficient to baffle all the stratagems of hell, and to
vanquish the most formidable enemies, Jesus is the Captain of
salvation, and his strength is the arm of the Lord God
omnipotent.&nbsp; If they want a foundation, whose stability is
adequate to the immense weight that rests upon it, Lo! Jesus is a
sure foundation and the rock of ages.&nbsp; Upon the covenant and
promises sealed with his blood they may securely rest their peace
and happiness, all their vast interests for time and
eternity.</p>
<p>That the mind may be formed into a susceptibility of these
great truths, the temper of a <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>little child must first be implanted
in it.&nbsp; For, while its natural pride and enmity remain,
there is nothing to which a sinner is so averse, as to that of
renouncing self, and being dependant for his whole salvation upon
the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; From hence arose the unwillingness
of the Jews to &ldquo;submit themselves unto the righteousness of
God;&rdquo; Rom. x. 3; and from the same bitter root sprung
self-righteous Saul&rsquo;s &ldquo;confidence in the
flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; Phil. iii. 4.&nbsp; But, as soon as the power
of God brought that once-elated Pharisee to the dust, and
effectually broke his heart, he who thought that he ought to do
many things contrary to the name of Jesus, is made to cry out to
that very person, whom he once blasphemed, &ldquo;Lord, what wilt
thou have me to do?&rdquo;&nbsp; From that moment, the lofty
self-justiciary became a little child, and ever after gloried
only in the cross.&nbsp; He learned to &ldquo;count all things
but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus the
Lord;&rdquo; Phil. iii. 8; esteemed himself nothing, and Jesus
all; and &ldquo;the life which he lived in the flesh, was by the
faith of the Son of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gal. ii. 20.&nbsp; The idol
of self-righteousness in his heart was pulled down, that Christ,
and Christ alone, might ever after possess, in all things, the
pre-eminence; as he must, in ours also, if ever we <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>would enjoy
a well-grounded hope of entering the kingdom of heaven.&nbsp;
Which leads me to consider,</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; How much every individual is concerned in the
subject, since our Lord declares, that, without conversion, in
the scriptural light in which it has been represented, none can
be partaker of his glory.</p>
<p>This awful declaration rests upon the veracity and power of
God, and upon the nature of that work of the Spirit, &ldquo;which
makes us <i>meet</i> to be partakers of the inheritance of the
saints in light.&rdquo;&nbsp; Col. i. 12.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Unconverted sinners can not enter the kingdom of
heaven, because the God of truth hath declared they <i>shall
not</i>.&nbsp; His word is more than ten thousand barriers in the
way.&nbsp; And his veracity is so engaged to defend and fulfil
every threatening, as well as every promise, that sinners might
as well expect that God should change his nature, as change his
word.&nbsp; Therefore if he hath said &ldquo;the wicked shall be
cast into hell;&rdquo; Psal. ix. 17;&mdash;&ldquo;he that
believeth not shall be damned;&rdquo; Mark, xvi. 16;&mdash;and
that, &ldquo;neither fornicators, nor isolators, nor adulterers,
nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor
thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor
extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God;&rdquo; <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>1 Cor. vi.
9, 10; we may be fully persuaded, that Jehovah will as certainly
fulfil these most tremendous threatenings, as if we saw the
accomplishment of them, this instant, with our eyes.&nbsp; Heaven
and earth shall pass away; but one jot or tittle shall in no wise
pass from the scriptures, until all be fulfilled.&nbsp; If Satan
suggest &ldquo;you shall not surely die,&rdquo; remember
&ldquo;he was a liar from the beginning;&rdquo; and that the
fatal consequence of crediting that original falsity, was a
confirmation of this unalterable truth, &ldquo;that the wages of
sin is death,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;what a man soweth that shall
he also reap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; When God makes a promise or denounceth a threatening,
his <i>power</i> as well as his faithfulness is exerted equally
to the accomplishment of the one and the other.&nbsp; No
intervention of second causes shall stay his hand, or obstruct,
or even retard his designs; because himself the great <span
class="smcap">First Cause</span> makes them all subservient to
his sovereign will.&nbsp; So that he must fulfil every promise to
his people, because his ability is equal to his veracity, and
both spring from his eternal willingness to do so.&nbsp; And he
will execute every denunciation of his wrath, because he
can.&nbsp; Could the potsherds of the earth contend successfully
with their Maker, they might then entertain some distant hope at
least of evading his threatenings, and eluding his <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>wrath: but,
before they can expect to accomplish either, they must first cope
with Omnipotence, and take heaven itself by storm: for, sooner
shall the great Jehovah be dethroned, and his dominion in the
heavens be subverted, than sinners unconverted be suffered to
dwell there.&nbsp; The hand of God himself shall shut the gates
of the celestial city against them; and all the power of the Lord
God Almighty shall be exerted, together with his truth and
justice, to keep them out, for ever.&nbsp; In vain shall the sons
of Belial attempt to enter; in vain shall they knock, and
importunately cry, saying, &ldquo;Open unto us.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Their exclusion will be announced and confirmed by those cutting
words of the Judge, &ldquo;Depart from me, for I know you
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But the admission of unchanged sinners to the kingdom
of God is an utter impossibility, because they want that
conformity of heart to the exercise of heaven, which is necessary
to make them willing to stay there, even if they were
admitted.&nbsp; And it was upon this ground, that our Lord told
Nicodemus, that &ldquo;except a man be born again, he could not
see the kingdom of God.&rdquo;&nbsp; John, iii. 3.&nbsp; By
regeneration, the aversion of the heart to spiritual exercises is
taken away, and a delight in them substituted in its stead.&nbsp;
But in a carnal <a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>mind this aversion is deeply rooted.&nbsp; And could a
sinner, under the influence of it, be suffered to enter the
kingdom of heaven, all the bliss of paradise would be no heaven
to him.&nbsp; Carrying with him an indisposedness of heart to the
employ of heaven, and having his eyes previously blinded by
carnal lusts, he would not see any beauty in the palace of the
great King, or enjoy any satisfaction in the beatific presence of
the King himself.&nbsp; Having been accustomed on earth to
frequent the company of the dissolute and the gay, he would feel
awkward and unhappy in the society of saints and angels.&nbsp;
All the harps of heaven would communicate no melody to his ears;
and the exercise of praise and adoration would appear, as it did
on earth, an intolerable burden.&nbsp; He would derive no
enjoyment even from that river of the water of life, that floweth
in a pure and perennial stream of happiness from the throne of
God, and of the Lamb: for, having left the world with his heart
full of carnal delights, the recollected pleasures of the
sensuality and dissipation below, would crowd in upon his mind to
mar all the felicity of heaven, and to make him prefer a
Mahometan paradise to the exalted fruition of the blessed God,
and all the refined pleasures which they taste, who contemplate
his perfections, and bask in the beams of his love.</p>
<p><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>Besides the want of a disposition to the employ of
heaven, there is in the hearts of the unregenerate a positive
enmity against God, and the laws of his kingdom, which makes them
rebels and enemies.&nbsp; And it cannot be supposed that such
could find a place in that harmonious society, where perfect love
to God is the bond of eternal concord and happiness among the
inhabitants of the New Jerusalem.&nbsp; As soon might the devil
and his angels expect to be translated to glory, as sinners, with
hearts fraught with enmity against God, hope for a place in his
kingdom.&nbsp; Rev. xxii. 11, 15.</p>
<p>From what has been said, it is evident,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That, as conversion is the work of God, to prescribe
&ldquo;rules&rdquo; for the sinner&rsquo;s own accomplishment of
it, as some legal authors have done, is palpably as absurd as to
furnish a man with a set of rules for making a world.&nbsp; For
the old and the new creation have one and the same agent; and he
is the Almighty Creator of the universe.&nbsp; Isa. xlv. 17,
18.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That conversion doth not consist in those things,
which the blindness of some, the pride of others, and the
pharisaical zeal of not a few, would substitute in its
stead.&nbsp; For instance; baptism is not conversion.&nbsp; It is
only the outward sign of it.&nbsp; And, to mistake the sign for
the thing itself, is as absurd as to make a shadow <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>equal to
the substance.&nbsp; The thing signified in baptism is, &ldquo;a
death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness:&rdquo; and
this is conversion.&nbsp; But how many content themselves with
having partaken of the outward ordinance, who do not understand
the significancy of the institution, and know nothing of the
blessings symbolically represented in it!&nbsp; &ldquo;He is not
a Jew, who is one outwardly,&rdquo; (nor is he a Christian who is
one no farther); &ldquo;but he is a Jew,&rdquo; (and a
Christian,) &ldquo;who is one inwardly: and circumcision,&rdquo;
(or baptism) &ldquo;is that of <i>the heart</i>, in the spirit,
and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. ii. 28, 29.&mdash;Neither does the great
change consist in a transient effect on the passions.&nbsp; These
may often be mechanically wrought upon, and violent emotions
excited in them, without the least concomitant influence from the
Spirit of God.&nbsp; One man may be affected under a sermon, and
another weep at a tragedy, and both be in the same predicament as
to their state of heart towards God.&nbsp; When the passions are
moved, because the affections are engaged, and the understanding
enlightened in the subject, then the work is produced, not by the
pathos of eloquence, or the violent mechanism of bawling and
unmeaning vociferation, but by the finger of God.&nbsp; A change
of the latter kind <a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>will be permanent and abiding.&nbsp; But conversions,
such as spring from a transient gust of passion, will always
evaporate, &ldquo;like the morning cloud or the early dew, that
passeth away.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hos. vi. 4.&mdash;It would be equally
absurd and dangerous to place true religion in an outward and
partial reformation, often accompanied with a shew of zeal,
which, at the bottom, is nothing but emptiness and
ostentation.&nbsp; When a man all of a sudden cuts off some
superfluities of naughtiness in dress and outward indulgence;
when he prunes off some excrescences, while the root of
corruption remains untouched; when to-day he acts the part of a
novice, and to-morrow, like a fungus that shoots up in a night,
he raises his head as a Reformer, without wisdom or materials for
beginning or conducting a reformation; in such cases, the
conversion is often from bad to worse; it is as if a harmless
statue should be transformed into a venomous reptile; or folly,
stealing the venerable garb of truth, should commence tyrant, and
like Solomon&rsquo;s madman, with the hand of outrageous zeal,
scatter about arrows, fire-brands, and death.&nbsp; Prov. xxvi.
19.&nbsp; From such conversions, and such converts as these, may
the Lord at all times defend and save his church!&mdash;To change
a denomination, or to adhere to that in which one may happen to
have been <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>born and educated, is not conversion.&nbsp; A man may
turn protestant, then turn calvinist, then turn arminian, then
turn methodist, then turn quaker or quietist, (an usual
transition,) then turn dissenter, and last of all turn churchman,
and yet, through all these revolutions, which have been more than
once exemplified in a single character, he may not once have
thought seriously of turning <span
class="GutSmall">CHRISTIAN</span>&mdash;a name infinitely more
honorable than all the empty titles that men assume to themselves
to distract the minds of their brethren, and to rear their own
consequence, often, upon the ruins of peace and union.&nbsp; Some
are, no doubt, very sincere, and highly to be commended, for
changing a denomination, when the interests of truth and the
prosperity of their souls, or the dictates of conscience, are the
objects in view.&nbsp; But there is not a greater delusion under
the heavens, than for a man to infer the safety of his state,
merely from an idea of the purity of the communion to which
accident or bigotry may have induced him to join himself.&nbsp;
To turn to a party, and to turn to God, are as different as light
and darkness.&mdash;As for those, who plead for their continuance
in the old beaten track of formality, because, as they say,
&ldquo;they will not change their religion,&rdquo; a discourse
upon the nature of true conversion is intended to convince <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span><i>such</i>, that <i>they have</i>, in fact, <i>no
religion to change</i>.&nbsp; And as for those, under the
influence of a more refined delusion, who place religion in the
espousal of orthodox opinions, which have no renovating influence
on their hearts and lives, and often take a false refuge in
doctrines, of which, alas! they never experienced the power; it
is necessary to tell these, and their partners in self-deception,
that religion is principally <span class="GutSmall">A
TEMPER</span>; and that to be really changed, is to have
&ldquo;the mind that was in Christ Jesus,&rdquo; to be governed
by that love, which St. Paul describes in 1 Cor. xiii.; and to be
influenced by the humble temper of a little child.&nbsp; Without
this, party is an insignificant badge, doctrines but chaff, zeal
but wild-fire, and conversion but a name.</p>
<p>To conclude.&nbsp; Whatever denomination we adhere to, or
whatever principles we espouse, let us remember, that, without
the power of vital godliness, such badges of distinction must
appear to him, who searcheth the heart, only as a &ldquo;sounding
brass, or a tinkling cymbal.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as I have labored
to urge this as a leading sentiment through the whole discourse,
every candid hearer must see, that the ambition of my heart, like
that of every disinterested servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>is, to be
instrumental, not in turning you to a particular name or favorite
persuasion, but in converting you to God.&nbsp; Whether, then,
you have erected your hopes, and built your system on the broad
but rotten base of infidelity; whether you have commenced a free
liver in consequence of being a free thinker&mdash;for they are
characters closely allied&mdash;or, with some right notions in
your head, betray a heart immersed in the world and dead in sin;
whether you are dissipated with the gay, dissolute with the
abandoned, or formal with the self-righteous; whatever accidental
superiority, by birth, education, or fortune, you may possess
above others; or howsoever applauded you may be for decency of
manners or regularity of outward devotion; yet, in whatever
light, either infidelity, libertinism, formality, or morality,
can place a character, the unalterable truth of the text stands
to cut off the fallacious pretensions of each.&nbsp; Conversion
implies infinitely more than any moralist upon earth can attain
to: and it differs as much from mere orthodoxy, as the genial and
vivid light of the sun doth from the faint beams of the pale orb,
that borrows light, but derives no heat, from his luminous
body.&nbsp; As for formality in religion, it is not even the <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>shadow of
that, of which it claims the essence.&nbsp; And as for the
profane and the licentious, <i>continuing</i> such, the text
stands as a barrier against the impiety of their principles, and
the presumptuousness of their hope.&nbsp; For, except they, and
the characters already alluded to, be converted, and become as
little children, they cannot enter into the kingdom of
heaven.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>If any man will do his will</i>, <i>he
shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
John, vii. 17.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> malevolent and unremitted
opposition, which the truths of revelation have met with from
infidels in all ages, hath made it necessary to urge every
argument, derived from the external and internal evidences of
Christianity, in order to demonstrate that its origin is from
God.&nbsp; This business of demonstrating would have been
altogether superfluous, were the heart of man naturally
accessible to truth and righteousness.&nbsp; But it is deplorably
sunk in prejudices against both, in consequence of an apostacy
from the Fountain of Wisdom.&nbsp; Hence, men quarrel with <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>revelation,
because they have first rebelled against the divine Author of
it.&nbsp; An innate aversion to the genius of true Christianity
is generally productive of controversies about the proofs of its
divine authenticity.&nbsp; Corruption in the heart of an infidel
prompts him to wish that some of the doctrines of the gospel may
not be true; because they hurt his pride, or propose a bridle to
his lusts.&nbsp; And what men earnestly wish, they at last bring
themselves obstinately to believe.&nbsp; From this unhappy
mixture of credulity and obstinacy in an infidel spring all his
objections to the dictates of reason, and the evidences of sacred
truth.&nbsp; But the cause of Christianity is supported on all
sides by pillars of such strength, that the efforts of its
adversaries to overturn the fabric, only serve to shew its
firmness, and to expose their weakness.&nbsp; Its plan originated
in the mind of Jehovah, and its foundation rests on eternal
truth.&nbsp; The same wisdom that arranged the universe modelled
the gospel system; and the creation of the world and the
revelation of truth in the Bible have but one and the same
Almighty Agent.&nbsp; This will appear, if we consider, as
proposed, the several arguments, that evince</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The divine origin of the doctrines of the
gospel.&nbsp; But these are so numerous, and would require such a
compass of reasoning to discuss <a name="page282"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 282</span>them fully, that I must content
myself with only giving you the outlines of them.&nbsp; The
principal of these, as far as the external evidences of
Christianity are concerned, are <i>prophecies</i> and
<i>miracles</i>.&nbsp; When events have been predicted thousands
of years before they happen, the correspondence between the fact
and the prophecy must be the effect of divine
interposition.&nbsp; Yet such a correspondence, the most
punctual, even in the minuti&aelig; of time and circumstances, is
visible from the very face of scripture prophecy.&nbsp; Miracles
are justly considered as an additional evidence of the divine
origin of any doctrine, and of the divine mission of him who
preaches it.&nbsp; And having been performed before a number of
credible witnesses, under circumstances of public notoriety, with
marks of preternatural operation, and with a tendency the most
beneficial to mankind, they become so many indubitable vouchers
to the cause of truth.&nbsp; Much accessional strength to this
sacred cause might be derived from a consideration of the
character of the first preachers of the gospel; who went forth to
spread its truths, under the expectation, not of ease and honor,
but of contempt, and poverty, and death itself; and, without any
aid, save what they derived from the presence and blessing of the
Lord, amidst universal opposition, erected the <a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>standard of
truth in divers countries, and planted truth in the most distant
regions of darkness and error.</p>
<p>But the internal excellences of the doctrine are among the
other proofs of its divine original.&nbsp; Here you meet with
none of the monstrous absurdities of paganism or superstition,
that have often made virtues of the most abominable passions, and
deified vice itself, by consecrating temples to lust and cruelty;
or that have dethroned both reason and religion, and established
the most egregious fooleries, as maxims of truth, and modes of
worship.&nbsp; Here every virtue is rescued from the false
glosses that had been imposed upon it by the craft, or ignorance,
or wickedness of men; and every moral precept is placed in its
true light of purity and extensive obligation; shewing, that what
is so pure in its tendency must have for its author the Holy One
of Israel.</p>
<p>What other system, but that of the gospel, produces such a
harmony between the divine perfections!&nbsp; Here,
notwithstanding the opposite claims of mercy and truth, justice
and peace, each is respectively honored, yet all mutually
harmonize.&nbsp; They meet at the cross of Jesus, and, from his
great propitiatory satisfaction, derive a power to unite with
perfect concord <a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
284</span>in the salvation of sinners.&nbsp; While Jesus bleeds,
justice is satisfied, truth is fulfilled, mercy erects her
throne, and peace extends an olive branch to a guilty world.</p>
<p>Where is the system that carries such marks of divinity, as
the gospel does? even from the suitableness of its provision to
the peculiar necessities of lost sinners?&nbsp; If any are
oppressed with fears, or burdened with a load of guilt; here they
are pointed to the fountain of a crucified Saviour&rsquo;s blood,
which is of infinite efficacy to heal the broken hearted, and
make the foulest clean.&nbsp; If the world is a scene of misery
and sin; here life and immortality are brought to light, and the
horrors of death changed into the portals of bliss.&nbsp; The
king of terrors appears bereft of his sting, and he that had the
power of death, that is the devil, receives his deadly
bruise.&nbsp; The weak and ignorant, the poor and wretched, are
invited to the feast, where all is of God&rsquo;s providing; and
all is offered without money and without price.&nbsp; Happy they
who obey the invitation, and taste of the rich provision!&nbsp;
Their own experience is then the best comment on the truth of the
text.&nbsp; They have an internal evidence of the truth of the
doctrine, because they have felt the power of it: which leads me
to consider,</p>
<p><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>2.&nbsp; Wherein consisteth the privilege of knowing
that the gospel is of God.</p>
<p>As the gospel is a system calculated equally to illuminate the
understanding and to renovate the heart; the blessedness of
knowing that it is from God, must be in proportion to the
greatness of the privileges which it communicates.&nbsp; And
these are, a deliverance from perplexing doubt and endless
speculation&mdash;a discernment of the way of truth&mdash;and
such an established persuasion respecting the believer&rsquo;s
personal interest in the Lord Jesus Christ, as quickens his
affections, and engages both heart and life in devotedness to the
Lord his God.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; As the fall of man hath plunged his intellectual
faculties in great darkness; in the investigation of truth and
the contemplation of spiritual objects, he thinks and judges as
absurdly as a man born blind would do, in an attempt to expatiate
on the nature and distinctions of colors.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for
they are foolishness to him; neither can he know them, because
they are spiritually discerned.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Cor. ii. 14.&nbsp;
And as long as this veil of natural obscurity covers his
understanding, the very same reason, which, on natural and
scientific subjects, exerts itself with such vigor and success,
leaves him the subject <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>of doubt and uncertainty on the
great concerns of eternity&mdash;the humiliating and unhappy
situation of every man by nature, from the grossly ignorant up to
the acute and learned blasphemer.&nbsp; What a blessing to be
extricated from all this scepticism and the darkness which
occasions it!&nbsp; To have the mind no longer distracted with
doubts and disquietude on what it is concerned to know!&nbsp;
This is the privilege of him who knows the gospel to be of
God.&nbsp; He is no longer tossed about with every wind of
doctrine, or agitated by the clashing opinions of men, who are
often more earnest to oppose one another than to investigate
truth.&nbsp; The spirit of God hath rent the veil of darkness,
and dissipated the mists that rendered his path doubtful and
perplexed.&nbsp; Retiring from the din of controversy, and the
niceties of the schools, he hath seated himself down at the feet
of Jesus, to learn, as an humble pupil, the truth from his
mouth.&nbsp; There he listens to that word, which, while it drops
refreshing as the dew on the tender herb, pours on his mind a
divine light, that puts an end to former cavils at the authority
of revelation, and to former doubts about the doctrines contained
in it.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A discernment of the way of truth and salvation is
one essential branch of that knowledge, <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>recommended
in the text.&nbsp; &ldquo;He that is spiritual judgeth
(&delta;&iota;&alpha;&kappa;&rho;&iota;&nu;&epsilon;&iota;
discerneth) all things.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Cor. ii. 15.</p>
<p>This branch of knowledge is essentially necessary to
constitute the being of faith, and the comforts of a
Christian.&nbsp; It is by &ldquo;the knowledge of Christ that he
justifies many.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isa. liii. 11.&nbsp; But that
knowledge implies the manifestative light and apprehensive power
of faith, by which an interior eye is opened in the soul to
behold the glory of Christ, and to cleave to his righteousness
for justification.&nbsp; Hence, St. Paul was so anxious to
&ldquo;know Christ,&rdquo; that he &ldquo;counted all things loss
for the excellency of that knowledge.&rdquo; <a
name="citation287"></a><a href="#footnote287"
class="citation">[287]</a>&nbsp; Phil. iii. 8.&nbsp; 2 Cor. iii.
18.</p>
<p>And could we suppose a Christian destitute of that light
necessary to discern the way of salvation, we must suppose him to
be the subject of very painful disquietude.&nbsp; Because, when
conviction of sin hath taught a man the knowledge of himself, and
made him weary and heavy laden with the burden of his guilt, a
discernment of the way of salvation must be imparted, in order to
buoy up the mind, and to support it under a load, which would
otherwise be insupportable.&nbsp; Therefore the Holy Spirit <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>operates as
a Divine Agent, and the gospel as a powerful instrument, in
manifesting the glorious sufficiency of Jesus Christ to the
sinner, and in drawing out his soul in hope and dependance upon
him.&nbsp; And to shew that a supernatural illumination is
requisite to this end, an inspired apostle compares the power
that effects it to that which commanded the light to shine out of
darkness at the creation.&nbsp; 2 Cor. iv. 6.&nbsp; So that, if
men pretend to any saving knowledge, and yet appear to be
ignorant altogether of the gospel salvation, if their knowledge
does not centre in him, and, by the Spirit&rsquo;s teaching, lead
to him, in whom God&rsquo;s people have their all; it is evident,
that the light in them is darkness. 1 Cor. xii. 3.&nbsp; John,
xvii. 3.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The privilege of knowing that the gospel is of God,
implies such an established persuasion of the believer&rsquo;s
personal interest in Christ, as quickens his affections, humbles
his heart, and engages body and soul in the consecration of all
their faculties to the honor and service of God.</p>
<p>This, it must be acknowledged, is not immediately the
privilege of many, who nevertheless know the things that belong
to their peace.&nbsp; Nor is it, in numerous instances,
vouchsafed, until, after a long series of various trials, by
which the soul is greatly exercised, but acquires <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>deep and
genuine experience.&nbsp; Some valuable Christians, who know the
gospel savingly, and adorn it greatly, are so bowed down with a
discouraging view of themselves, that unbelief robs them of that
comfort, which they are warranted to take from the promises, made
to those, who come to Christ by faith; and it is a considerable
time, often, before they arrive at any well-grounded evidence of
their title to heaven; though the inheritance is secure to them,
and their title to it as valid, as the purchase of Christ and the
immutability of the covenant could make it.&nbsp; It is, however,
their privilege to overcome their doubts, to have a clear view of
their interest in the Son of God, to rejoice in hope of future
glory, and to know that, &ldquo;when the earthly house of this
tabernacle is dissolved, they have a building of God, a house not
made with hands, eternal in the heavens.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2 Cor. v.
1.&nbsp; These invaluable blessings are called by the Apostle,
&ldquo;the riches of the full assurance
&pi;&lambda;&eta;&rho;&omicron;&phi;&omicron;&rho;&iota;&alpha;
of understanding;&rdquo; Col. ii. 2; and are the result of that
establishment in the knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of
God, which &ldquo;fathers in Christ&rdquo; enjoy, when they
become rooted and grounded in the truth as it is in Jesus.&nbsp;
Let not the weak and self-diffident, then, be discouraged.&nbsp;
He who maketh &ldquo;the path of the just to resemble the shining
light <a name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
290</span>that shineth more and more unto the perfect day,&rdquo;
Prov. iv. 8, will, in his own time, dispel the clouds that hang
over their minds, and make the day-star arise in their hearts
with assurance and consolation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then shall they
know, if they follow on to know, the Lord: his going forth is
prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto them as the rain,
as the latter and former rain unto the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hos.
vi. 3.</p>
<p>If any think that this established persuasion, or
appropriating knowledge of Christ, is apt to beget pride and
presumption in the heart; let it be remembered, that the
objection, plausible as it may appear at first view, is entirely
overthrown by this single consideration, that the kind of
knowledge, which the gospel conveys to the heart, is always
clothed with humility, and productive of holiness.&nbsp; Did it
imply a fond opinion of a man&rsquo;s superior claim to the
divine favor above his fellow-sinners, in consequence of supposed
superior merit; or, did it allow of indulged self-confidence of
heart, and licentiousness of manners; then, indeed, the assurance
I plead for, would be presumption of the most pernicious and the
most dangerous sort, and the knowledge it springs from would be
worse than the most profound ignorance.&nbsp; But this is far
from being the case.&nbsp; Self-knowledge attends every step of
the believer&rsquo;s progress in <a name="page291"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 291</span>the knowledge of Christ; and an
abiding sense of his dependance upon the Redeemer for every
thing, must of course check the risings of vanity, and keep him,
where a sinner ought to be, in the vale of self-abasement.&nbsp;
In that humble frame, he sees himself nothing; and while he
reviews the unspeakable obligations, which the undeserved grace
of God hath laid him under, and reflects upon the innumerable
benefits, which Jesus hath bought for him with his precious
blood; his heart overflows with gratitude to the kind Donor of
his mercies; and the language of it is, &ldquo;What shall I
render unto the Lord?&rdquo;&nbsp; Words are weak and
inexpressive to speak the sentiments of his mind, either when he
views himself, or contemplates the unsearchable riches of
Christ.&nbsp; And the predominant desire of his soul is to grow
in grace and in the knowledge and love of Christ.&nbsp; His
advancement herein keeping pace with the knowledge of himself, a
poor dependant sinner all his life; from hence flows a desire,
and, through grace, a determination, to evidence the humility and
gratitude of his heart, by giving the glory of his salvation
wholly to Jesus, and by dedicating himself in righteousness and
true holiness to the honor and service of his divine <span
class="smcap">Lord</span> and <span
class="smcap">Master</span>.</p>
<p>And it will appear, upon calm consideration, that the
knowledge, which the text recommends, <a name="page292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>and the fruits which always attend
it, are perfectly correspondent with the genius of the gospel,
and the end for which it has been sent to the children of
men.&nbsp; Its great design is to abase the sinner, exalt the
Saviour, and promote holiness.&nbsp; And the kind of knowledge I
wish to inculcate, is specifically of that nature; by which all
possible honor is given to Christ, and the heart penetrated with
an habitual conviction of the necessity of glorifying him in body
and spirit, which are his.&nbsp; How can he be elated, who knows
that he has nothing to glory in but the cross of Christ?&nbsp;
How can he be presumptuous, whose assurance rests upon the
promise and him that made it?&nbsp; Or can he possibly want
motives to obedience, or a principle of gratitude, whose eyes are
opened to behold the salvation that rescued him from sin and
hell, and whose heart is filled with love to the gracious Author
of salvation?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; If the enemies of truth are
disposed to seek for objections against our experience and our
principles, let them find some more plausible than that of a
charge, which might with great ease and greater justice be
retorted upon themselves.&nbsp; A proud presumptuous spirit,
inflated with vanity, filled with speculation, puffed up with
self-conceit, and void of humility, we disclaim, because we think
it the very bane of all religion.&nbsp; And the <a
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>amiable
idea, which a Christian would wish to give of religion, is that
of a man, who, the more he knows, the more he sinks into
self-abnegation; whose head is filled with light, and his heart
with love; and who would rather feel a little genuine poverty of
spirit and contrition of heart, than possess the most shining
endowments.&nbsp; And, that this apology for the principles and
temper of a true Christian is a just one, will still farther be
made evident, if we consider,</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; What is necessary to the attainment of that
knowledge which the text promiseth.</p>
<p>If the general plan of redemption, or the several constituent
parts of that plan, be accurately surveyed, it will appear
throughout to have been a very leading design of its great Author
to pour contempt on those things, which are highly esteemed among
men; and to adopt a procedure in all his dispensations directly
subversive of those principles, which are most commonly
received.&nbsp; Had he acted in conformity to the maxims and
pretensions of the world, men of wisdom, of prowess, and of
nobility, should have been his sole favorites.&nbsp; But that the
very reverse is the case, is evident from St. Paul&rsquo;s
testimony in 1 Cor. i. 26; who asserts, that &ldquo;God hath
chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and
weak <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>things of the world, to confound the things which are
mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are
despised, yea and things which are not, to bring to nought things
that are; that no flesh should glory in his presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In no respect does this truth appear to be more remarkably
verified, than in the kind of pre-requisite, which infinite
wisdom hath thought proper to fix upon as necessary to the
attainment of divine knowledge; which is, not what human policy
would have recommended, profound learning, an acquaintance with
sciences, languages, or philosophy; but a willingness
&epsilon;&alpha;&nu; &tau;&iota;&sigmaf;
&lambda;&epsilon;&lambda;&eta; to do the will of God; a temper of
mind that is humble and docile, and that has been brought into
subjection to the will of God, as revealed in the
scriptures.&nbsp; What that will is, the following considerations
will determine: 1. That it is the will of the Father, that the
objects of salvation should honor the Son by looking to him as
their propitiation.&nbsp; For, the work, will, and commandment of
God, is, that we should believe in Christ to that end.&nbsp; 1
John, iii. 23.&nbsp; 2. That they should be set apart for the
glory of God, by the dedication of soul and body to his
service.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is the will of God, even your
sanctification.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Thes. iv. 3.&nbsp; 3. That they
should renounce conformity to the world, and all friendship <a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>with those
who inordinately love the things that are in the world, the lust
of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life.&nbsp;
Rom. xii. 2. 1 John, ii. 15, 16.&nbsp; 4. They should take up the
cross, and tread in the footsteps of the blessed Jesus; following
his illustrious example in doing and suffering the will of heaven
with patience and resignation; in a crucifixion to the world, and
an ambition for the honor and favor that cometh from God.&nbsp;
This is called &ldquo;doing the will of God from the
heart,&rdquo; Ephes. vi. 6, and is opposed to the doing of it,
partially, insincerely, or by constraint.</p>
<p>As true Christianity is of practical tendency, <i>doing</i>
the will of God is contra-distinguished from a mere knowledge of
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not every one that saith Lord, Lord, shall enter
into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of the
Father.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mat. vii. 12.&nbsp; For, though a man cannot
<i>do</i> the divine will, without having previously <i>known</i>
it; yet a knowledge of it is often entirely destitute of any
sincere inclination to perform it.; and in every such case,
&ldquo;he that knoweth his Master&rsquo;s will and doth it not,
shall be beaten with many stripes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Luke, xii.
47.&nbsp; So that, while, the word of God abounds with severe
reproofs and awful denunciations against those, who are under the
power of that self <a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>deception, which makes them content with being hearers
of the word, and not doers of it, and leaves them satisfied with
some head-knowledge, though accompanied with carnality and
hypocrisy of heart; the same sacred word gives all imaginable
encouragement even to those, who are <i>willing</i> to conform to
the will of God, though between their wishes and their practice
there should be a considerable disparity, and the weakness of
their faith should throw many impediments in their way.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Lord will not despise the day of small things.&nbsp;
He will not break the bruised reed nor quench the smoking
flax.&nbsp; To that man will he look, that is poor and of a
contrite spirit, and trembleth at his word.&rdquo;&nbsp; Zech.
iv. 10.&nbsp; Isa. xlii. 3.&nbsp; Isa. lxvi. 2.&nbsp; These, and
promises of similar import, confirm the truth of the text, and
embolden every true follower of Christ to look for a fulfilment
of them in his experience; while with child-like simplicity of
heart, and an earnest desire to be taught of God, he diligently
useth the means of instruction, and waits for that blessing,
requisite to render them effectual.&nbsp; Such persons the Lord
will take by the hand, and guide into the way of truth, and
peace.&nbsp; He will open to them the mysteries of his kingdom;
and unfold the riches of his grace.&nbsp; The secret of the Lord
is with them; and he will shew them his covenant.&nbsp; <a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>He will
manifest himself to them, as he doth not to the world; and shine
upon their ways with a progressive and cheering light.&nbsp; They
shall become conversant in the deep things of God, and
acknowledge those very doctrines to be of divine original, which
at first they trembled to receive.&nbsp; They shall see their
consistency, and know them to be of God, from their effects;
since the doctrines of distinguishing, efficacious, and
victorious grace, and these alone, have a tendency to make the
heart humble, holy, and happy, and to keep it so; to support the
believer in an hour of temptation, and to help him to trust in
the everlasting covenant when he walketh in darkness and hath no
light.&nbsp; And, when multitudes of the presumptuous and
self-confident, who soar on the wings of a towering profession,
shall faint and grow weary, and utterly fall into error and sin;
they shall hold on their way, and wax stronger and stronger, they
shall mount up on wings as eagles, they shall run and not be
weary, they shall walk and not faint.&nbsp; Fed by the sincere
milk of the word, their souls shall grow and thrive; and
experiencing the preciousness of the promises, they shall
anticipate with joy their fulfilment in glory.&nbsp; Safe in the
everlasting arms of Divine protection, they shall be kept from
every fatal snare.&nbsp; And happy in the <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>guidance of
the Holy Spirit, they shall enjoy the influence of that Divine
Comforter, until all the clouds of sin and error being passed
away, a flood of divine light and ineffable glory shall break in
upon their souls, and they shall sin, sorrow, and complain no
more for ever.</p>
<p>Having shewn, that the doctrine of the gospel is of divine
original&mdash;from the prophecies and miracles that attest its
divinity&mdash;from the purity of its system, equally remote from
the monstrous absurdities of paganism and superstition&mdash;from
the harmony it produces between the divine attributes&mdash;from
its utility and suitableness to the condition of fallen man;
having considered the privilege of knowing that this doctrine is
of God; and having shewn what is necessary to the attainment of
that knowledge, I shall conclude with observing,</p>
<p>In the first place, that a rejection of the gospel argues a
want of that temper necessary to investigate truth; and that
pride, or an attachment to some beloved lust, is at the bottom,
whereby the judgment is corrupted and the heart depraved.&nbsp;
Hence be assured, that evangelical truth and moral righteousness
are inseparably connected; and that ignorance of, or opposition
to, the truth, is the road direct to every immoral and dangerous
path.</p>
<p><a name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
299</span>Secondly, since a willingness to do the will of God is
the pre-requisite towards attaining the knowledge recommended in
the text; let us confine ourselves to this simple criterion of
heavenly wisdom and of a gracious heart, and not look for marks
of it in the parade of learning and pomp of profession, among
those, who, upon these superficial grounds alone, boast of
superior knowledge.</p>
<p>Thirdly; since to know the gospel, is the privilege of a
renewed mind; and to practise its precepts, the result of a
divine power; how should we importune the Father of lights to
give us the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of
his Son; without which, we must grope in the dark and fall into
error!&nbsp; Mat. xi. 27.</p>
<p>Lastly; encouraged by the salutary promise in the text, let
the timid and unestablished plead it in faith before the throne
of grace.&nbsp; God is faithful to fulfil what he hath spoken;
and the experience of his people hath borne testimony to his
veracity and his compassion in all ages.&nbsp; Plead the promise
in the all-meritorious name of Jesus, in whom all the promises
are yea and amen.&nbsp; Urge the covenant engagements of the
Father to him, whereby he hath promised that all his children
shall be taught of God.&nbsp; Expect no favor upon your own
account; <a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>but look for every thing from him, in whom all fulness
dwelleth, and in whom the Father is well pleased.&nbsp; Let not
some difficulties, or a little suspense, discourage you.&nbsp;
Continue instant in prayer.&nbsp; Wait in faith, in hope, in
patience.&nbsp; And the God of all grace, who hath called us unto
his eternal glory by <span class="smcap">Christ Jesus</span>,
after that ye have suffered awhile, make you perfect, stablish,
strengthen, settle you!&nbsp; To him be glory and dominion for
ever and ever!&nbsp; Amen.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> history, to which the words of
the text refer, is extremely memorable.&nbsp; During the
captivity of the Jews, a variety of singular events concurred to
prove that the sins, which brought desolation upon their country,
and subjected them, for a period of seventy years, to the
Babylonish yoke, had not, nevertheless, wholly alienated the
affections of Jehovah from them, or dissolved that covenant
relation which he had originally adopted towards them, as the
&ldquo;God of Abraham,&rdquo; and that any act of indignity
perpetrated against an afflicted people, or <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>any insult
cast upon the service of their temple, would be recognized as the
highest affront to the Majesty of Heaven, and not be suffered to
pass with impunity, though the perpetrators were the princes and
potentates of the earth.</p>
<p>Of this, Belshazzar is a remarkable instance.&nbsp; He was
grandson to Nebuchadnezzar, and had an opportunity of seeing, in
the divine dispensations towards his royal ancestor, how hateful
pride is, even in royalty itself; how instantly God can blast the
most blooming dignity of the brightest crown, and reduce him that
wears it to a condition level with the beasts that perish; how
quickly, when the divine decree goeth forth, a haughty rational
can be converted into a brute, and a Nebuchadnezzar, in all the
pomp of majesty upon his throne, be driven from human converse,
and become a fit associate only for oxen that graze the field,
and are wet with the dew of heaven; and how much, therefore, the
prosperity of kings, and the stability of their thrones, depend
upon acknowledging, that &ldquo;the <span class="smcap">Most
High</span> ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to
whomsoever he will&mdash;that all the inhabitants of the earth
are reputed as nothing; that he doeth according to his will in
the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and
none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest
thou?&mdash;that his <a name="page303"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 303</span>works are truth, and his ways
judgment; and those that walk in pride he is able to
abase.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dan. iv. 25, 35, 37.</p>
<p>But this instruction, though conveyed through a dispensation,
calculated to write it upon his heart as indelibly as with a pen
of iron, or the point of a diamond, seems to have been all lost
on Belshazzar.&nbsp; In a depraved and debauched mind, the most
striking memorials of divine interposition are soon buried in
oblivion; and all the impressions, which the most tremendous
judgments of God generally make in such a case, only resemble
characters made in the sand, which the first flux of the tide
totally obliterates.&nbsp; Belshazzar had undoubtedly often heard
the memorable history of his royal grandfather, and could not
avoid seeing in it the great outlines of that divine system of
truth, which inculcates the evil of sin, and recommends the fear
of the Lord as the supreme wisdom.&nbsp; The very sight of those
fields, where Nebuchadnezzar once roamed, or of the animals with
which he herded, when deposed from his throne, and deprived of
his understanding, must have brought to his recollection the
singular event, that so strongly marked God&rsquo;s displeasure
at all sin; especially that kind of it, which lifts up the heart
with atheistic pride, and prompts arrogant worms of the earth to
affect independence of <a name="page304"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 304</span>Him, &ldquo;in whom they live, and
move, and have their being.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Belshazzar, like
libertines in all ages, buried the remembrance of these things in
his cups, and company; or sought relief from any disquieting
apprehensions, in the fulsome flattery of the civil and
ecclesiastical sycophants, that herded round his throne, and
constituted his levee.&nbsp; Thus soothed into a false security
by court adulation or pulpit-daubing, he became a beast in
sensuality, and indulged in every sordid gratification, that
could make him hateful to God, and contemptible to man; in which
we may suppose him to have been immersed the more deeply, for
want of some faithful monitor near his person, to tell him the
truth, like honest Micaiah, without dread of royal
resentment.&nbsp; There was one man in Belshazzar&rsquo;s
kingdom, who was especially qualified for this important office;
but he had not the opportunity, being a Jew, and a captive, till
a singular event brought him out of his obscurity, and displayed
the superiority of his wisdom above all the pretenders to it in
Belshazzar&rsquo;s court.</p>
<p>Upon a particular day, Belshazzar made a feast, to which were
invited &ldquo;a thousand of his lords.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dan. v.
1.&nbsp; Being a lewd polygamist, like all the heathen princes of
the East, &ldquo;his wives and his concubines&rdquo; formed a
part of his guests; for, to an abandoned prince a palace <a
name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 305</span>hath no
beauty unless it be a receptacle for prostitutes; the whole
apparatus of a court appears incomplete without a seraglio; and
in the esteem of the drunken king of Babylon, or the grand Turk
with Mahomed&rsquo;s Koran in his hand, there are no blessings
comparable with the blessings of polygamy.&mdash;Belshazzar, thus
environed with his concubines and his lords, pushes about his
intoxicating goblet, and poured out libations, or toasted the
memory of their &ldquo;gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of
iron, of wood, and of stone.&rdquo;&nbsp; Verse 4.&nbsp; Proper
deities, it must be acknowledged, to preside in <i>such</i>
assemblies, in which the songs of the drunkard, and the
conversation of the lascivious, render the scene perfectly worthy
of all that indecency and excess, which idolatry ever promoted
among its votaries.&nbsp; The king of Babylon, not content with
blending idolatry and voluptuousness together, at his luxurious
feast, where lords and whores unite to strengthen him in his
wickedness, adds sacrilege to his other sins.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels, which
Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in
Jerusalem; that the king and his princes, his wives and his
concubines, <i>might drink therein</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Verse
2.&nbsp; Thus this impious prince insulted the God of heaven by
sacrilegiously profaning those vessels that had <a
name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 306</span>been
consecrated to the service of his temple; as if his wine would be
doubly sweet, when drank out of God&rsquo;s sacred chalice, or
the vessels of his holy sanctuary were only fit to be prostituted
to the purposes of riot and excess.&nbsp; In the desecration of
these vessels, the temple-worship was profaned, a captive people
insulted, and an atrocious act of indignity committed against the
Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p>While Belshazzar was thus employed in filling the vessels of
the temple with intoxicating liquor, God was filling for him the
phials of his indignation.&nbsp; He bent his bow and made it
ready; and the moment was approaching in which the barbed arrow
of swift destruction was to be directed by an unerring hand
against Belshazzar and his kingdom.&nbsp; A most awful presage of
this event is given, when least expected.&nbsp; In the midst of
the entertainment, while the king and his guests are absorbed in
pleasure; behold! a strange phenomenon arrests the solemn
attention of the gay circle, and suddenly damps all their
mirth.&nbsp; Every face turns pale, and every heart is filled
with a horrible dread.&nbsp; Their festivity and carousings are
changed into confusion and despair.&nbsp; The sumptuous
entertainment entertains no longer; and the wine, sparkling in
the glass, or mantling in the goblet, can yield no antidote
against <a name="page307"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
307</span>the chilling fears that seize the hearts of the
disturbed guests.&nbsp; The mirth and gaiety of this festive
assembly are changed into silence, solemnity, and
distraction.&nbsp; But what occasioned so instantaneous a
perturbation?&nbsp; Was it the appearance of some angry cherub,
like him whom God appointed as the flaming guardian of the tree
of life? or, was it the discovery of some instrument of death
suspended from the ceiling over the king&rsquo;s head, like that
sword, which hanging by a hair over Damocles, the base flatterer
of a Sicilian tyrant, disturbed his peace in the midst of a
banquet?&nbsp; No; it was nothing more than &ldquo;the fingers of
a man&rsquo;s hand, writing over against the candlestick upon the
plaister of the wall of the king&rsquo;s palace,&rdquo; verse 5,
&ldquo;and the king saw the part of the hand that
wrote.&rdquo;&nbsp; He saw, and trembled.&nbsp; But what ailed
thee, O Belshazzar! that thy peace should be broken at the sight
of an object, that carried nothing hostile in its outward
appearance?&nbsp; Ah! it is not the first time that a sinner has
been made to tremble at hand-writing, when the hand of God
appears to hold the pen.&nbsp; Belshazzar&rsquo;s conscience
instantly commented upon the mysterious characters.&nbsp; The
hand of God wrote his doom, and his own guilty fears anticipated
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;His countenance was changed, and his thoughts
troubled him, so that the joints of his loins <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>were
loosed, and his knees smote one against another.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Verse 6.&nbsp; To what an abject and pusillanimous condition, a
consciousness of guilt, and a dread of punishment, reduce often
the most stout hearted!&nbsp; Nay, &ldquo;the wicked fleeth, when
no man pursueth, while the righteous is bold as a
lion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Prov. xxiii. 1.</p>
<p>Belshazzar, distracted and amazed, cries aloud to bring in the
astrologers and soothsayers.&nbsp; A considerable reward is
offered to those, who should read and interpret the
writing.&nbsp; They try, but in vain.&nbsp; The queen advises to
consult Daniel.&nbsp; He is brought before the king.&nbsp; The
honest Hebrew tells him of his pride, idolatry, and
sacrilege.&nbsp; He reads the writing, and gives the
interpretation; which was, that &ldquo;God had numbered his
kingdom and finished it; that he was weighed in the balances and
found wanting; and that his kingdom was divided and given to the
Medes and Persians.&rdquo;&nbsp; Verse 26&ndash;28.&nbsp; The
interval between the writing of this awful prediction, and the
accomplishment of it, was very short.&nbsp; For &ldquo;in that
night&rdquo; was Belshazzar surprised by an army headed by Cyrus,
&ldquo;and slain,&rdquo; and the kingdom of the Chaldeans
transferred by conquest to that of the Medes and Persians.&nbsp;
Thus judgments tread close upon the heels of guilt, and are
sometimes as swift in their progress, as they are sure in their
arrival; <a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>the commission of sin, and the infliction of
punishment, happening, not seldom, at the same instant.</p>
<p>Let us now, first, make some practical observations on the
history referred to in the text; and, secondly, accommodate the
images in it to the purpose of forming a scrutiny into the hearts
and lives, the principles and pretensions, of sinners.</p>
<p>I. 1.&nbsp; The profanation of things sacred is highly
affrontive to the Divine Majesty; incurs great guilt, and exposes
to danger in proportion; because God himself is virtually
dishonored in the abuse or contempt of what relates to his
service.&nbsp; The men of Bethshemesh only look into the ark, and
Uzzah only touches it, and God instantly punishes the presumption
of the one, and the profane curiosity of the other, with judicial
chastisement.&nbsp; And it is not so much the act as the
intention of the agent, that God regards in such a case.&nbsp;
Under circumstances of peculiar necessity, David &ldquo;eats the
shewbread, which it was not lawful for any to eat but the
priests.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet this infringement of a positive
ceremony passes with impunity, because God considered the nature
of the case, and saw the purity of David&rsquo;s intention.&nbsp;
But when the king of Babylon sent for the vessels of the temple,
it was evident, that he meant <a name="page310"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 310</span>studiously to affront the God of the
Jews, and to make the people and their religion objects of
malicious triumph, and &ldquo;cruet mockery.&rdquo;&nbsp; By thus
blending the cup of the Lord with the cup of devils, Belshazzar
filled up the measure of his iniquity, and provoked Jehovah to
make his punishment as conspicuous as his impiety was
public.&nbsp; As sacrilege is a sin of very comprehensive
application, let us beware how we rob the Most High of the honor
due to his <i>truths</i>, his <i>ordinances</i>, his <i>name</i>,
and his own <i>day</i>.&nbsp; And particularly, let us see to it,
that we profane not that sacred institution, which is
commemorative of the death and passion of our Lord Jesus Christ;
when we reflect, what judgments this species of profanation
brought upon the Corinthian Church.&nbsp; And, as public feasts
are too often scenes of voluptuousness and intoxication, where
the sons of riot sometimes amuse themselves with ridiculing
religion and its advocates; and instead of partaking of
<i>such</i> mirth, which is perhaps made up of the obscene jest,
or the horrid oaths and imprecations, of the indecent and
profane; let us fly from the place, as from the very confines of
hell.&nbsp; And, be assured, that &ldquo;only fools make a mock
at sin;&rdquo; and that, though God in general is patient, though
provoked every day, yet he sometimes strikes offenders dead upon
the <a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
311</span>spot, and calls them to his bar, just as the lie or the
blasphemy was issuing from their mouth. <a
name="citation311"></a><a href="#footnote311"
class="citation">[311]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Sensuality and security in sin, are the certain
presages of impending ruin.&nbsp; When the wicked say in their
hearts, &ldquo;Tush, God careth not;&rdquo; or the worldling
counting his riches, and wrapping himself in false tranquillity,
breaks out into that sordid soliloquy, &ldquo;Soul take thine
ease, thou hast much goods laid up in store; eat, drink, and be
merry;&rdquo; then the storm is at the blackest, and the angry
cloud ready to burst.&nbsp; Transgressors take occasion to sin,
because &ldquo;vengeance against an evil act is not speedily
executed;&rdquo; and the people of the world often draw
flattering inferences respecting one another from outward
prosperity or inward gaiety; measuring their interest in the
divine favor by the extent of their rent-roll; or, the degree of
their happiness, by the height of their levity.&nbsp; <a
name="page312"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 312</span>But, alas!
they consider not that the ox is fattened to the slaughter, and
that &ldquo;the prosperity of fools shall destroy
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The world, like a true Delilah, makes a soft
lap for her votaries to sleep on; but it is only to render them a
more easy prey to the enemies that lie in wait, and consign them
over to drudgery more servile than that of Sampson deprived of
his sight, shorn of his locks, and grinding in a mill at
Gaza.&nbsp; Besides, it is not considered, that God&rsquo;s
judgments, though long protracted, are sure; and are the more
tremendous, for being delayed.&nbsp; They are often conducted,
and operate, like the mine, which is sprung in the dark, and
which never discovers its subterranean progress, until it
involves all around it in darkness, uproar, and ruin.&nbsp; A
sensualist is never nearer the verge of destruction than when he
speaks peace to himself; and a &ldquo;foolish virgin,&rdquo;
assuming the appearance of happiness, while a life of perpetual
thoughtlessness and dissipation destroys time, and unfits for
death and judgment, is only like the moth that is at last
consumed in the flame that attracted it.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; See how easily the carnal repose of the wicked may be
disturbed, in the height of their voluptuousness and
festivity!&nbsp; This may be effected at any time by a variety of
incidents or instruments.&nbsp; God need only drop a slight
sensation <a name="page313"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
313</span>of wrath upon the conscience; suffer that faithful
vicegerent to assume the office of severe remonstrance; or let
loose Satan with his train of accusations upon the sinner, and
immediately all is tumult and disquietude within.&nbsp; For,
&ldquo;when he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and
when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be
done against a nation, or against a man only?&rdquo;&nbsp; Job,
xxxiv. 29.&nbsp; Let God but give a reverse of fortune, and touch
that mountain of prosperity on which the proud and opulent
elevate their hopes so high; and down fall all their imaginary
peace and bliss in a moment.&nbsp; How low they build, who build
beneath the skies! when the fabric and the builders of it may be
crushed together before the moth.</p>
<p>O ye dissipated and profane, consider, before it be too late,
that he, who surprised the king of Babylon at his feast, and
called him, unprepared, from his cups to a tribunal; will one day
come suddenly as the thief in the night, and put an end to your
mirth, by the summons of the archangel&rsquo;s voice, and the
trump of God.</p>
<p>I might here call your attention to the singular contrivances
of divine wisdom displayed, in the case of Daniel, with a view to
exalt debased and injured excellence; or, consider, how incumbent
it is upon Christ&rsquo;s ministers, when <a
name="page314"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 314</span>called
upon, to do it, in imitation of the illustrious Hebrew, with
faithfulness and impartiality, even before kings.&nbsp; But
waving any enlargement upon these points, I shall proceed to
state, as the last practical observation upon the history before
us,</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; How unsafe and fallacious it is, to infer any
man&rsquo;s happiness or infelicity, merely from outward
appearances, be they ever so specious, or afflicted.</p>
<p>Behold Belshazzar upon his throne!&nbsp; Contemplate the
magnificence of his palace, and the extent of his empire.&nbsp;
He looks around upon Babylon, the superb residence of his court,
and calling &ldquo;the glory of the Chaldees excellency&rdquo;
his own, thinks himself the happiest and most august monarch of
the East.&nbsp; Thousands do him homage, and tens of thousands
bow at his footstool.&nbsp; The earth and seas are ransacked to
supply his table with delicacies; and he needs only ask, to have
every luxury that the most unbounded appetite could desire.&nbsp;
Multitudes live upon his smile, and princes triumph in the honor
of being in the train of his dependants.&nbsp; His word is a law,
and confers dignities or death at pleasure.&nbsp; And the grand
emulation among courtiers, domestics, and subjects, is, who shall
be first in obedience to the tyrant&rsquo;s edicts.&mdash;Such is
Belshazzar <a name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
315</span>on his throne.&nbsp; But could we only have followed
him to his secret retirements, or looked into his breast, we
should have seen all this semblance of splendor and felicity
tarnished by some corroding care, that banished repose even from
his bed of down; or some vicious passion, that preyed continually
upon his heart.&nbsp; A dreadful rival in power, a sullen
contemner of his false dignity, like another Mordecai, refusing
to bow to impious Haman, or a single disappointment in the
pursuit of dominion and conquest, were sufficient to make his
diadem tremble on his brow, and to plant such sharp thorns in the
crown that adorned it, that a man upon the rack could not be more
miserable than the haughty monarch of Babylon seated on his
imperial throne.&nbsp; Who, therefore, would not have preferred
the situation of a peasant in his cottage, or that of the poorest
captive Jew within the walls of Babylon, before the grandeur of a
palace, in which wretchedness and sin took up their abode?</p>
<p>But, follow Belshazzar to his banquet.&nbsp; See him seated at
the head of his convivial assembly.&nbsp; The sumptuous feast is
prepared; and his lords sit down to share in the
entertainment.&nbsp; The charms of beauty, and the harmony of
music, are called in, to heighten the repast.&nbsp; Every face
shines with mirth, and every heart <a name="page316"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 316</span>overflows with joy.&nbsp; The
richest juice of the vine contributes, in abundance, to the
festivity of the scene.&nbsp; And, to the heart of an epicure, or
in the eye of a bacchanalian, there never was a more pleasing
object than Belshazzar, at the head of his lords and concubines,
laughing at religion, toasting his favorite gods, drinking
destruction (as it is probable he did) to the poor captive Jews,
and getting drunk out of the hallowed cups that once adorned
their temple.&nbsp; But, should any really think this jovial
assembly a happy one, let them remember the <i>text</i>, and the
<i>hand</i> that wrote it.&nbsp; Look from the festive board to
the <i>lettered wall</i>.&nbsp; What is written there?&nbsp; Then
turn to Belshazzar.&nbsp; See, he looks aghast, and
trembles!&nbsp; Whither is his mirth fled?&nbsp; Why are his
lords astonished?&nbsp; What will his riches and the glory of his
kingdom do for him now?&nbsp; See him falling under the sword of
a victorious adversary; and, after death, falling into the hands
of the living God; and then say, who would have been in his case,
for his crown and empire? or, for a thousand worlds?</p>
<p>From hence it is manifest, that, in order to judge aright of
happiness, we must look deeper than the surface, and farther than
the passing moment.&nbsp; The completest misery is, often,
permitted to assume a smiling countenance; and <a
name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 317</span>it is only
the event of things that is to throw light on the mysteries that
veil present dispensations.&nbsp; A fallacious outside deceives
and deludes the world in general.&nbsp; And were our judgment to
be guided by the opinions, or our practice modelled by the lives
of many, we should conclude, that the rich man &ldquo;clothed in
purple and fine linen, and faring sumptuously every day,&rdquo;
had the best pretensions to happiness, and Lazarus at his gate,
full of sores, was misery itself; till we heard, that the one was
translated to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom, and that the other was
lifting up his eyes in the torments of hell.&nbsp; With a view,
therefore, to detect the fallacy and danger of such conclusions,
and to brush the vermilion from the cheek of painted misery or
gilded error, I go on, as proposed, to</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Accommodate the images in our text to the purpose of
forming a scrutiny into the hearts and lives, the principles and
pretensions, of sinners of various complexions.</p>
<p>The principal image in the text is taken from a custom, which
hath prevailed amongst all nations, of regulating commercial
intercourse, by the test of the balance, or of determining the
value or deficiency of any commodity, by certain standard
weights.&nbsp; In allusion to this mode, the adjustment of which
formed a part of that sacred code of juridical ceremonies, <a
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>which God
gave to the Jewish legislator; the king of Babylon is represented
as put into the balance.&nbsp; His kingdom, and the glory
thereof, his crown and sceptre, his wealth, dominion, and titles,
are put in with him.&nbsp; These would be thought objects of
prodigious appreciation in the eyes of the world, and would weigh
immensely heavy in the false balance of human estimation; as they
probably did, in the opinion of Belshazzar and his abandoned
court.&nbsp; But it is not a human hand that holds the balance,
or the eye of a superficial mortal that is to watch its
preponderation.&nbsp; No; the beam is suspended from God&rsquo;s
hand, and the balance is to be regulated by <span
class="smcap">One</span>, in whose sight &ldquo;a false balance
is an abomination.&rdquo;&nbsp; Prov. xi. 1.&nbsp; Belshazzar is
weighed by Him, who can neither err nor be deceived.&nbsp; And
the result of the scrutiny is, that he is found wanting.&nbsp;
His moral character is defective, weighs nothing.&nbsp; The glory
of an <i>empire</i> cannot make up for what is wanting in the
<i>man</i>.&nbsp; In God&rsquo;s account, an act of truth or
mercy outweighs a kingdom; and, without holiness, earthly
dignities are as the small dust of the balance, and all sublunary
excellence lighter than vanity itself.&nbsp; Belshazzar&rsquo;s
whole empire is no counter-balance against Belshazzar&rsquo;s
iniquities.&nbsp; And, while a court or pulpit-flatterer
pronounces bliss and glory in the <i>king</i>, God <a
name="page319"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 319</span>makes no
other account of his royalty, than to damn it in the
<i>sinner</i> with the greater emphasis.</p>
<p>Let us borrow the striking imagery in the text, and apply it
to ourselves.&nbsp; Let each individual fancy himself
represented, as a mortal and a sinner, in the person of the king
of Babylon, before his doom was fixed, and his life hung in
suspense.&nbsp; Let him suppose himself,&mdash;his principles and
pretensions,&mdash;his heart and life,&mdash;put into the
balance.&nbsp; The scriptures of the Old and New Testament, in
perfect coincidence with each other, are the two sacred
even-balanced <i>scales</i>, by which his whole self is to be
weighed.&nbsp; As the decalogue is the great standard of moral
rectitude, and the gospel is the test of evangelical principles;
I hope it will not be any straining of the metaphor, to consider
the <i>two tables of the law</i>, and the <i>requisitions of the
gospel</i>, as the just <i>weights</i>, by which the pretensions
of the pharisee and the soaring professor are to be examined;
since we are commanded to bring every thing to the test of
&ldquo;the law and the testimony.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is the more
requisite, because the <i>essential truth</i> of God is the
<i>beam</i>, from whence the two scales of scripture are
suspended, and by which they are made to connect in perfect
harmony.&nbsp; Let us consider the hand of infinite
<i>justice</i> as holding <a name="page320"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 320</span>the balance, weighing its contents,
and determining the value.&nbsp; And let every sinner under
heaven fancy himself thus subjected to the examination of the
Most High God, and his state to be determined by his just and
unalterable judgment; while the fate of his never-dying soul is
to be fixed for ever by the issue.&nbsp; It is in vain to attempt
either to supersede or elude this scrutiny.&nbsp; For, it is
carrying on, every moment, though by an invisible process; death
is now hovering round the head of every one of us, and only waits
for the divine commission to take out of the scale what God hath
weighed in it, and to turn over the sinner to that tribunal,
which retributive justice shall one day erect.</p>
<p>In detecting the fallacious hopes and specious principles by
which mankind are deceived and destroyed, it is necessary that we
weigh in the balance of the sanctuary, all <i>human
righteousness</i>, all the <i>possessions of earth</i>, and all
the <i>pleasures of sense</i>.&nbsp; These are the three
principal sources, from whence men, in general, are labouring to
derive happiness.&nbsp; And if I can only convince them that
every one of these springs is dry, and that happiness floweth in
a pure and perennial stream from a different fountain; much may
be done towards bringing them to the enjoyment of what they have
hitherto pursued, <a name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
321</span>with fruitless search, in objects calculated rather to
ensure misery, than procure happiness.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; When it is proposed to put to the test all human
righteousness, I mean by that term, every kind and degree of
moral obedience, which a sinner in his natural state can perform,
and upon which he builds his hopes of heaven.&nbsp; As the
scriptures positively declare, that &ldquo;there is none
righteous, no, not one;&rdquo; it is plain, at first view, that
the terms <i>human righteousness</i> are intended to describe
only what is so called, not what really exists.&nbsp; For, since
that degree of moral rectitude, which implies perfection of
obedience to the law of God, is no longer the claim of fallen
sinners; the word righteousness is used, as the language of the
self-justiciary, not as the concession of truth.&nbsp; So that,
when I adopt these terms, I do it, in order to prove, that the
language of many, on theological subjects, is as improper as
their pretensions are ill-founded.</p>
<p>Now, that you may be convinced that all human righteousness,
as a ground of acceptance before God, is absolutely ideal, and
forms no part whatever of that moving cause, which prompted
Jehovah to confer upon us the blessings of his kingdom, please to
recollect that it is written, &ldquo;<i>Not</i> by works of
righteousness <a name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
322</span>which we had done, but according to his <i>mercy</i> he
saved us.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tit. iii. 5.&nbsp; Mercy presupposes guilt
and wretchedness.&nbsp; And to say that sinners, who possess no
previous works of righteousness, but require to be dealt with as
objects of divine compassion, are notwithstanding righteous, and
must be saved by the merit of their works, is one of the grossest
solecisms in divinity, that the church of Rome itself could ever
have established in her erroneous creed.&nbsp; Besides, when
revelation points us to the Mediator of the new covenant, as to
one who sustains the office of a <i>Saviour</i>, how can any man,
that pays the least deference to divine authority, suppose,
without violating the dictates of even common sense, that he can
save himself, and at the same time give the glory of salvation to
the Lord Jesus Christ?&nbsp; Upon the plan of the erroneous
hypothesis I am combating, the truth of man&rsquo;s depravity
must be denied, and the glorious redemption of the Son of God
altogether vacated.&nbsp; So that, before a sinner can arrogantly
plead his own righteousness, as the meritorious cause of his
salvation, he must first reason himself out of common sense, and,
in the face of allowed truths and indisputable facts, endeavour
to demonstrate that he is not a sinner, nor Christ a Saviour.</p>
<p><a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 323</span>But,
let us examine the bold pretensions of human righteousness by the
moral law.&nbsp; This is the standard of equity and the
touchstone of truth.&nbsp; Before it gives the denomination of
<i>righteous</i> to any act, or of <i>righteousness</i> to any
agent, the law requires perfect, pure, universal, and
uninterrupted obedience.&nbsp; A single failure even in thought,
makes a man virtually a transgressor of the whole law, and brings
him instantly under its curse.&nbsp; For, &ldquo;if a man keep
the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; James, ii. 10.&nbsp; The law requires too, that
not merely some, but all its precepts should be observed not only
in the letter, but also in the spirit of them; and not only for a
certain space of the life of man, but also from the commencement
to the close, with every moment inclusive.&nbsp; For, it is
written again, &ldquo;Cursed is every one that <i>continueth</i>
not in <i>all</i> things written in the book of the law to do
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gal. iii. 10.&nbsp; The Apostle Paul
contemplating the sanctions of the moral law, and its requirement
of universal and incessant conformity, when compared with the
corruption of human nature, and the utmost efforts of all human
works, draws this inference from the humiliating comparison,
&ldquo;If righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in
vain.&nbsp; Knowing that a man is not justified by the <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>works of
the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ; for, by the works of
the law shall no flesh be justified.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gal. ii. 16,
21.</p>
<p>Let every person, now, who fondly supposes his soul is safe,
because he is outwardly moral, or that his works will merit
heaven, put all the very best performances he can glean up in the
balance of truth.&nbsp; Put your works of charity, of
benevolence, of devotion, your sincerity, your prayers, and your
alms, in one scale.&nbsp; In order to render it as heavy as
possible, you are welcome to throw in every thought, word, and
action, by which you suppose you have honored God, benefited your
neighbour, or profited yourself.&nbsp; Now, only lay in the
opposite scale, the two tables of God&rsquo;s righteous law,
inscribed with its holy sanctions, rigorous precepts, and
extensive requirements.&nbsp; While we are watching the turn of
the beam, give me leave to ask, Have you kept the <i>whole</i>
law?&nbsp; Did you ever violate it in a single point?&nbsp; Has
there been any interruption in your obedience?&nbsp; Has your
heart been <i>always</i> pure from every sinful thought, and your
life from every immoral act?&nbsp; The law requires this, without
admitting the smallest abatement in its demands.&nbsp; Now view
the balance.&nbsp; See how it preponderates on the side of the
law.&nbsp; Your scale, containing all your works, flies up, and
<a name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>kicks
the beam.&nbsp; Your righteousness, compared with that of the
law, is only as a bubble to the globe.&nbsp; God writes
<i>Tekel</i>, where you have written <i>Merit</i>.&nbsp; Thou art
weighed in the balance and art found wanting.&nbsp; You may
perhaps urge, &ldquo;All these things have I kept from my youth
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the young formalist in the gospel thought, to
whom Christ said, &ldquo;<i>One</i> thing thou
<i>lackest</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as you cannot produce perfection
of obedience, all your charity, formality, morality, will avail
nothing.&nbsp; You want a justifying righteousness, but you have
it not in yourself, nor can you get it from the law.&nbsp; As a
&ldquo;ministration of death,&rdquo; 2 Cor. iii. 7, it condemns
you and denounceth a curse; while justice, like the angel armed
with a flaming sword, stands ready to inflict the merited blow,
should you pertinaciously dare to touch the tree of life with the
hand of merit.</p>
<p>But, should you ask, what is to be done, while the balance is
suspended in the hand of impartial justice?&nbsp; I answer, Cry
for mercy, as an offender, and look to <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span> as a complete <span
class="smcap">Saviour</span>.&nbsp; But take care of blending his
merit with your own, or of making a convenience of his
righteousness to supply the defects of yours.&nbsp; This would be
to aggrandize yourself at the expense of his honor.&nbsp; You
must not presume to put Christ&rsquo;s excellency in the balance
with your <a name="page326"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
326</span>works, in order to give them the required weight.&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; You must, with a self-renouncing hand, first take out
all your own works, leaving not one behind in the scale, and then
with the hand of faith put in Christ&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; This
will weigh heavy.&nbsp; His atoning blood and perfect obedience
will counterbalance the requisitions of law and justice; will
give your conscience peace; save you from hell; and introduce you
without spot into the presence of the Holy One of Israel.&nbsp;
Thus the apostle of the Gentiles was enabled to act, after he saw
the ruin of his nature, and the spirituality of the moral
law.&nbsp; His own words are a perfect comment on the truth I
have just now endeavoured to establish.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yea
doubtless,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and I count all things but loss
for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for
whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them
but dung (&sigma;&kappa;&upsilon;&beta;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;
offal) that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having
mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is
through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by
faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; Phil. iii. 8, 9.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Let us examine the weight of earthly possessions,
comprehending under that head the greatest accumulation of
wealth, and the most unlimited extent of empire, accompanied with
the most distinguished titles of dignity <a
name="page327"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 327</span>and
honor.&nbsp; Now, the very height of these saith,
&ldquo;Happiness is not in me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having a tendency to
deprave the appetite, and sensualize the affections, the things
of earth, in ten thousand instances, have so much of the alloy of
misery mixed with them, that it is with great reason God in his
word saith, &ldquo;This is not thy rest, for it is
polluted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Terrestrial good is of too gross a nature
to satisfy the vast desires of an immortal spirit; and every
portion of it is held by a most precarious tenure.&nbsp; Vexation
in the pursuit, and disappointment in the fruition, attend those,
who seek for a heaven in earth.&nbsp; All the acquisitions of the
world cannot fill the vacuity in a mind, destitute of the
&ldquo;true riches.&rdquo;&nbsp; Put, therefore, the whole globe
in one scale, with all the pomp and opulence of which it boasts;
and only lay in the other, the interests of a never-dying soul,
and the vast concerns of an awful eternity; then say, what is the
world, but a dream; and its enjoyments, but vanity?</p>
<p>Ye that dote on earth, and are building tabernacles in this
wilderness, consider ye not, that the place of your residence
will ere long know you no more for ever; and that this
terrestrial ball, were you possessors of all the riches that are
buried in it, could not make you truly rich or happy, without the
knowledge of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; You have had experience of its
insufficiency in <a name="page328"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
328</span>these respects; and yet continue the fruitless chase in
the very same track, where disappointment and vexation have often
strewed briers and thorns before.&nbsp; Your mind is still upon
the wing; your hopes, still big with expectation.&nbsp; The world
has teased you with solicitations, flattered you with promises,
and deceived you in the moment of anticipation.&nbsp; Yet you
trust the flatterer, and live still upon her smiles.&nbsp; Though
you have smarted under her rod, yet you continue still a drudge
to her maxims; sometimes determined to throw off her yoke, and
yet anon enamored with her service, in hope of better days.&nbsp;
She has given you riches, perhaps, or worldly prosperity, but has
denied you peace.&nbsp; All this time, death is hastening on
apace.&nbsp; Sickness visits as his forerunner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Grey
hairs are here and there upon you, and you know it
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; You and the world are weighed together in the
balance, and are found wanting.&nbsp; The world cannot make you
happy; and you want discernment to see it.&nbsp; You want,
perhaps, neither assiduity nor wisdom in the management of
temporal things; but in those which are spiritual and invisible,
all your ingenuity deserts you.&nbsp; You are deficient in great
matters; in little and unimportant ones, you are sedulous, to
excess.&nbsp; You want to know, what you are least of all anxious
to learn; and that <a name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
329</span>is, <i>that to know Jesus Christ</i>, <i>and him
crucified</i>, <i>is the very centre of happiness and the summit
of wisdom</i>.&nbsp; Without this knowledge, all human science is
imperfect; and all earthly opulence abject penury.&nbsp; You have
few wants, or none, perhaps, for your body; but, while opulence
pours her favors around you with a luxurious hand, you may be an
utter stranger to the more substantial blessings of the grace of
God.&nbsp; O sirs, consider this seriously before it be too
late.&nbsp; Though your lives should glide along with ever so
smooth and placid a stream, yet remember, the boundless ocean of
eternity is just before you; and you may find <i>that</i>, a more
turbid sea than you expect.&nbsp; And I am certain you will, if
the love of the world be not previously expelled your hearts, to
make room for the love of Jesus.&nbsp; After you have passed the
limits of time and the confines of death, it will be too late to
say, the world is a cheat, I thought so once, but now I know
it.&nbsp; Experience then will be hell.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But may not the votary of pleasure put in his claim
to happiness, without having his principles examined, or his
dissipation interrupted by rigid inquiries?&nbsp; No.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She that liveth in pleasure is dead while she
liveth.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is an act of charity to arrest levity in
a career that deprives of all seriousness, and unfits for another
<a name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>world;
and though a solemn admonition may be unwelcome at first, it may
be admitted as a salutary visitant in the end.</p>
<p>I will suppose you then possessed of every advantage, which
youth, health, and fortune, can give; while, perhaps, your
education and natural temper render you an object of envy to all
around you.&nbsp; Your time flies imperceptibly along in the gay
world; and diversified scenes of amusement, in concurrence with
constitutional vivacity, give you the appearance of felicity in
the very abstract.&nbsp; Happiness is the object of your pursuit,
and pleasure the way, which you think must lead to it.&nbsp; But
are you what you seem?&nbsp; Or have you attained what you have
been seeking?&nbsp; Is there not an emptiness in your enjoyments,
which you are made sometimes deeply to feel?&nbsp; Nay, do they
not often leave a sting in the heart, which the constant
succession of them, so far from extracting, only makes more
impoisoned?&nbsp; Is there no solemn moment, wherein conscience
doth loudly cry, &ldquo;You are not happy?&rdquo;&nbsp; And can
all your dissipation keep you from low spirits, when death stares
you in the face, and secret misgivings make you dread his
approach?&nbsp; You want something still, and that cruel
something unpossessed, mars all your gaiety.&nbsp; You want
Christ.&nbsp; You lack the knowledge and love of <a
name="page331"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 331</span>that divine
personage; and in wanting him, you want every thing&mdash;wisdom,
righteousness, holiness, heaven.&nbsp; You must be born from
above by the spirit of God.&nbsp; Your heart must be renewed, and
the corruptions of pride and discontent, of formality and
self-righteousness, which are lodged in it, must be conquered by
the grace of God.&nbsp; And, until that great change takes place,
you must and would be miserable upon a throne, and discontented
even in an Eden.</p>
<p>And now, men and brethren, suffer the word of
exhortation.&mdash;Yet a little while, and this present scene of
things shall come to an awful close; when rolling years shall
cease to move, and the great Angel shall lift his hand to heaven,
and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever, that <i>time
shall be no more</i>.&nbsp; Then the veil that hath parted the
visible and invisible world shall be thrown back; and all the
mysteries of eternity shall burst upon our astonished view.&nbsp;
Methinks I see the Judge enthroned, the judgment set, and the
books opened.&nbsp; Imagination anticipates the circumstances of
that decisive period, while faith almost realizes the appearance
of Messiah.&nbsp; The trumpet sounds, and he is coming.&nbsp; Go
ye forth to meet him.&nbsp; Are you ready?&nbsp; Are your lamps
burning?&nbsp; See eternal justice once more lifts her balance,
and weighs in her <a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
332</span>impartial scale, the world and its inhabitants.&nbsp;
Methinks I hear the <span class="smcap">Judge</span> pronounce
the awful words, &ldquo;Thou art weighed in the balance and art
found wanting;&rdquo; and reiterate them, as often as souls,
unwashed in the blood of the Lamb, and unrenewed by his spirit,
pass from his tribunal.&nbsp; O sirs, take care how you slight
the way of salvation, lest your ears should be forced to hear
that tremendous sentence.&nbsp; Mercy&rsquo;s door is now
open.&nbsp; Enter by it, and live for ever.&nbsp; Neglect it, and
you will find the judgment-day will shut it to eternity.&nbsp;
Beware how you trifle with the gospel, that directs you to <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span>.&nbsp; It is God&rsquo;s message of
mercy and peace to a lost world.&nbsp; It requires credit and
demands obedience.&nbsp; It is <i>our</i> message, because the
Head of the church hath committed to our trust this word of
reconciliation.&nbsp; I have this day endeavoured to be faithful
in the delivery of it.&nbsp; See that you contemn it not.&nbsp;
If you do, remember, you must answer for it at the judgment-seat
of Christ.&nbsp; O fly, fly to the throne of his grace, before
you are summoned to his bar!&nbsp; To-day, while it is called
to-day, harden not your hearts.&nbsp; To-morrow you may be in
eternity!</p>

333</span>SERMON IX.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">THE
PREPARATION REQUISITE FOR THE DAY OF JUDGMENT.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Prepare to meet thy GOD</i>, <i>O
Israel</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Amos</span>, iv.
12.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> concise but comprehensive
address contains one of the most solemn warnings, that can
possibly sound in the ears of sinful mortals.&nbsp; <i>Prepare to
meet thy God</i>!&nbsp; Awful sentence!&nbsp; Every word in it is
fraught with meaning, is big with importance; and rings an alarm,
louder than the voice of ten thousand thunders.&nbsp; Who can
read it with inattention?&nbsp; Who can hear it with
irreverence?&nbsp; Who can preach upon it, without deeply
feeling, himself, the weighty truths he enforceth?&nbsp; And yet
the most nervous language must be inexpressive, and the warmest
sentiment flat, when compared with a subject, <a
name="page334"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 334</span>which, for
majesty and importance, rises infinitely above all the powers of
description or the utmost stretch of conception itself.&nbsp; To
whose heart is it not sufficient to carry, at least, a transient
impression of seriousness?&nbsp; Methinks when the solemn
sentence, <i>Prepare to meet thy God</i>, is repeated, the votary
of pleasure, even in the giddy whirl of dissipation, is made to
think, and levity itself, for a moment, looks solid; an
irresistible awe seizes the mind of the licentiate, that
imbitters his gratifications, and disturbs his sensual repose;
that extorts a sigh from the unrelenting breast of impenitence,
draws a tear from the eye of the prodigal, and forces a blush
into the hardened cheek of immodesty itself:&mdash;even the
daring <i>infidel</i> himself cannot stand the shock of the
solemn warning; he starts&mdash;turns pale&mdash;looks
aghast&mdash;and all the guilt of his conscience, all the
misgivings of his heart, and all the horrors of his mind, fly
into his pallid countenance, as so many witnesses against his
atheistical principles, as so many vouchers for the truth of
revelation; so that, methinks, even infidelity itself for a
moment believes, and trembles.</p>
<p>In the context, (i.e. the passage immediately connected with
the text,) we shall behold an additional evidence to the
solemnity and importance of the warning before us.&nbsp; There
the <a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
335</span>prophet is reciting the various judgments with which
God had visited Israel; the end he had in these severe
visitations; and the strange incorrigibleness of the people under
them, and after their removal.&nbsp; The judgments were, famine,
drought, blasting, and mildew, the pestilence, the sword, and an
overthrow of some of their cities, judicial and final, like that
of Sodom and Gomorrah.&nbsp; Dreadful and numerous as those
public, those national calamities were; yet Israel was not
humbled, did not repent.&nbsp; <i>Yet have not ye returned unto
me</i>, <i>saith the Lord</i>, is the complaint of God himself,
as annexed by the prophet to every verse, that recites their
visitations.&nbsp; Jehovah spoke to them repeatedly, and awfully,
by the <i>rod</i>; but they would not hear it, nor did they
regard <span class="smcap">Him</span> who had appointed it.&nbsp;
He <i>met</i> them in his judgments.&nbsp; All of them were his
<i>messengers</i>; each had a <i>voice</i>, that spake loudly for
God and vehemently against sin; and all, in accents thundering
through their land, solicited the dutiful attention of the
inhabitants.&nbsp; But in vain.&nbsp; Though they were obliged to
give those dreadful visitants the meeting, yet they would not
give them an humble audience.&nbsp; They were too busy to hear;
too proud to submit; too stubborn to obey.&nbsp; Well, since the
embassadors are despised, the king will resent the affront: <a
name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 336</span>since they
would not regard the harbingers, all the <span
class="smcap">Majesty</span> of God shall summon them to an
interview.&nbsp; One meeting more is therefore determined upon;
in which the holy and eternal God himself shall be one of the
parties, and an incorrigible and rebellious people, the
other.&nbsp; <i>Prepare to meet thy God</i>.</p>
<p>From the words thus stated, I propose, with a view to our
personal improvement, considering,</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; That there will be a certain, an awful, a
swiftly-approaching, and an inevitable <i>interview</i> between
God and sinners.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; What kind of <i>preparation</i> it is incumbent upon
sinners to make in the prospect of that interview.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; After which, I shall, in an applicatory way,
consider, <i>to whom</i> the warning is directed.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The interview;&mdash;1. at death; 2. in the day of
judgment.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>It is appointed unto all men once to die</i>,
agreeably to the original sentence delivered to our first
parents, <i>Dust thou art</i>, <i>and unto dust shall thou
return</i>.&nbsp; <i>For</i>, <i>as by one man sin entered into
the world</i>, <i>and death by sin</i>; <i>so death passed upon
all men</i>, <i>for that all have sinned</i>.&nbsp; Rom. v.
12.&nbsp; <i>The wages of sin is death</i>.&nbsp; Rom. vi.
23.&nbsp; That we might be impressed with a due sense of the
<i>cause</i> of that awful change which passeth upon <a
name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 337</span>man at his
dissolution; the scriptures uniformly ascribe it to the first
man&rsquo;s disobedience, in which was involved the sin of his
posterity, and death, as one portion of the entailed
penalty.&nbsp; The scriptural account of the origin of death, as
very precisely and satisfactorily traced in the 5th chapter of
the epistle to the Romans, is, that Adam sinned; that <i>in
him</i>, as a public person, &#7952;&phi;&rsquo; &#8102;,
<i>all</i> sinned; and that, because all <i>sinned in</i> him as
their representative, therefore all die through him, or are
obnoxious to death, the very moment they are born, and are <i>by
nature the children of wrath</i>.&nbsp; Ephes. ii. 3.</p>
<p>After the scriptures of truth have instructed us in the origin
of sin, they then proceed to a description of that calamity of
universal influence&mdash;death, with which are connected
innumerable woes.&nbsp; This is done, with a view to impress man
with a solemn truth, which every trifle tends to obliterate from
his mind, viz. <i>that he must die</i>; to humble him under a
sense of that guilt, from whence his mortality originated, and to
solemnize and prepare him for an event as inevitable, as
uncertain, in the time of its arrival.</p>
<p>Hence death is represented as a king of mighty power,
extensive dominion, and universal sway; before whose
unconquerable arm, even conquering kings themselves fall; and to
<a name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>whom, as
to a superior potentate, they must resign those very trophies
that marked their own conquests, together with all the glittering
regalia of sceptres, diadems, and thrones, which lie as spoils at
death&rsquo;s footstool.&mdash;As a king of <i>terrors</i>; whose
train is composed of the terrific attendants of the pestilence,
the famine, the sword, the earthquake; and all the numerous
maladies which attack the body, or torture the mind; by which, as
by a great army, death invades this <i>microcosm</i> man, and
converts the globe into an <i>aceldama</i> or field of blood,
filled with promiscuous heaps of slain.&nbsp; As a monster, armed
with a <i>sting</i>, 1 Cor. xv. 56, so <i>pointed</i> as to
strike through the liver of the stoutest transgressor; so
impoisoned, as to communicate a venom, which mocks all the powers
of medicine; and so <i>deadly</i>, as, by its baneful influence,
to blast health in its highest vigor, and youth in perfect prime;
and to reduce the outward fabric of man to a state, humble as the
dust, and vile as the crawling reptile.</p>
<p>This king of terrors, this deadly monster, all must
meet.&nbsp; He is a messenger of the Almighty.&nbsp; He bears a
warrant signed in the court of heaven.&nbsp; He has executed his
commission already upon millions; and millions more shall fall
before his invincible arm.&nbsp; Even now he is knocking at the
door of thousands of our fellow-mortals, <a
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>and God
only knows, who next may be accosted by this awful
visitant.&nbsp; In the midst of fancied security, and boasted
health, this invisible foe may be this very moment whetting his
scythe, and meditating a blow at the healthy and the strong;
while the pampered miser, who says to his soul, <i>Soul take
thine ease</i>, <i>thou hast much goods laid up in store</i>,
<i>eat</i>, <i>drink</i>, <i>and be merry</i>, may be instantly
the first to be surprised with the unexpected call, <i>Thou
fool</i>, <i>this night shall thy soul be required of
thee</i>.</p>
<p>If death call, we must hear.&nbsp; If he summon, we must
obey.&nbsp; If he enter our doors, we must give him the
meeting.&nbsp; Who can stay his hand?&nbsp; Who can reverse or
even retard the execution of his summons?&nbsp; Is he to be
bribed by <i>wealth</i>?&nbsp; Is he to be repelled by
<i>force</i>?&nbsp; Can <i>titles</i> or <i>honors</i> demand his
partiality?&nbsp; Will he compliment the dignified, or the
opulent?&nbsp; Can entreaties move him?&nbsp; Or,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Can <i>flatt&rsquo;ry</i> sooth the dull,
cold ear of death?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No.&nbsp; He is as impartial, as he is relentless and
inexorable.&nbsp; He pays no respect to age, sex, rank, or
fortune.&nbsp; He visits equally the palace and the
cottage.&nbsp; The king and peasant are alike indiscriminate
objects of his summons.&nbsp; Crowns and sceptres are no more in
his estimation, <a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
340</span>weigh no more in death&rsquo;s balance, than rags or
pebbles.&nbsp; The prince and the subject, the wise and the
foolish, the healthy and invalid, the beautiful and deformed,
<i>shall lie down alike in the grave</i>, <i>and the worms shall
cover them</i>.&nbsp; Job, xxi. 26.&nbsp; <i>The small and the
great are there</i>; Job, iii. 19; <i>in that land of
darkness</i>, <i>as darkness itself</i>, <i>and of the shadow of
death</i>, <i>without any order</i>, <i>where the light is as
darkness</i>.&nbsp; Job, x. 22.</p>
<p>Sin makes man meet death; and death brings him to a meeting
with God.&nbsp; Those, who would not meet him, in his ordinances,
by <i>prayer</i> or through <i>faith</i>, in a Mediator, shall be
<i>forced</i> to an interview with the holy and eternal Jehovah
at his tribunal, to <i>give an account for all the deeds done in
the body</i>.&nbsp; To those, who <i>have washed their robes and
made them white in the blood of the Lamb</i>, Rev. vii. 14, this
meeting will be the commencement of perfect, perpetual, and
uninterrupted bliss: but to the unrighteous it will be, beyond
description, horrible.&nbsp; To <i>these</i>, death comes as an
executioner; lays his axe to the root of the trees; and gives the
fatal blow.&nbsp; If rotten and fruitless, down they fall, and so
they lie as fuel fit for <i>everlasting burnings</i>.&nbsp; Isa.
xxxiii. 14.&nbsp; Then the wicked launch into eternity; are
consigned over to the bar of God; and receive their eternal
doom.&nbsp; The instant life&rsquo;s silken cord is broken, and
the <a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>soul
dislodged from the body, the sinner is either transported on the
wings of cherubs to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom, or lifts up his eyes
with <i>that rich man</i>, in endless torments: if he meet God in
his sins, unpardoned and unconverted; God meets him as a
<i>consuming fire</i>, Heb. xii. 29, clad in all his vengeance
and terrors.</p>
<p>O sirs, it is this consideration, that strips death of all
that unimportance, with which, from the frequency of its arrival,
it is viewed, in general, by a thoughtless world.&nbsp; <i>To
die</i>, sounds common, and appears trivial; but not so, <i>to
die and be damned</i>, <i>or to die and be saved</i>.&nbsp; When
we consider, that either eternal damnation, or eternal salvation,
is the instant and inseparable consequence of death; how wicked,
how diabolically absurd, are the jests of the infidel and the
wit, when affecting to smile at that solemn event!&nbsp; However,
with all the affected gaiety of the proud and the profane, when
they come to lie on a death-bed, their mirth will forsake them,
and all the boasted heroism of infidelity sink in a dreadful
succession of horror and dismay.&nbsp; And no wonder; since</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not <i>the dying</i>, but
&rsquo;tis <i>this</i> they fear,<br />
To be&mdash;they know not <i>what</i>, they know not
<i>where</i>!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prospect of meeting the Lord God Almighty, constitutes the
bitterest drug in the <a name="page342"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 342</span>cup of the wicked, and is the most
tormenting thought, in the view of their dissolution, that racks
them on the verge of eternity.&nbsp; How would they court death,
and solicit his arrival; were it not, that <i>after death is the
judgment</i>!&nbsp; How gladly would they meet and embrace the
messenger, could they but be excused from meeting that God; the
light of whose countenance makes heaven, but in whose frown, is
hell!&nbsp; From a reluctance to do this, arise dismal
apprehensions, dreadful impatience, torturing doubts, and a
tormenting anxiety to live.&nbsp; All which conflict of raging
and tumultuous passions, in a soul, at the article of
dissolution, and upon the point of meeting God, is most
beautifully described in the following striking imagery of the
poet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In that dread moment, how the frantic
soul<br />
Raves round the walls of her clay tenement!<br />
Runs to each avenue; and shrieks for help!<br />
But shrieks in vain!&nbsp; How wishfully she looks<br />
On all she&rsquo;s leaving, now no longer her&rsquo;s!<br />
A little longer, yet a little longer,<br />
O might she stay, to wash away her crimes,<br />
And fit her for her passage!&nbsp; Mournful sight!<br />
Her very eyes weep blood; and every groan<br />
She heaves, is big with horror!&nbsp; But the Foe,<br />
Like a staunch murd&rsquo;rer, steady to his purpose,<br />
Pursues her close through ev&rsquo;ry lane of life,<br />
Nor misses once the track; but presses on;<br />
<a name="page343"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 343</span>Till
forced at last to the tremendous verge,<br />
At once she sinks,&rdquo;&mdash;sinks into the bottomless and
gloomy gulf of everlasting darkness and death!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Awful plunge!&nbsp; Dreadful exit!&nbsp; What heart can
conceive, or tongue describe, the state of an immortal soul,
trembling on the brink of fate; arrested by death; the prisoner
of guilt and fear; reluctant to depart, yet viewing dissolution
inevitable; looking forward to eternity with painful dread, and
backward, upon the world, with sorrow and regret; unwilling to
go, yet unable to stay; soliciting a reprieve for a year, another
month only, or even a week, but denied one moment&rsquo;s delay;
putting off in imagination or in wish, what is present to sense;
quitting the world, and bidding an everlasting farewell to all
its enjoyments, with nothing in prospect to compensate for the
loss; at length, forced to launch, though sure of shipwreck; and
nothing in view, but a black abyss, a forfeited heaven, and an
angry God!&nbsp; This is the end that awaits the wicked.&nbsp;
This is the fate of those who die without Christ!&nbsp; Oh that
the consideration might awaken the fears of the careless, and
prompt the people of God, <i>to give diligence to make their
calling and election sure</i>!&nbsp; 2 Pet. i. 10.&nbsp; And yet
this is not all.&nbsp; For,</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; We must meet God at the judgment-day; when <i>he will
judge the world in righteousness by </i><a
name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span><i>that
man</i>, <i>whom he hath appointed</i>.&nbsp; <i>Our God shall
come</i>, <i>and shall not keep silence</i>: <i>a fire shall
devour before him</i>, <i>and it shall be very tempestuous round
about him</i>.&nbsp; <i>He shall call to the heavens from
above</i>, <i>and to the earth that he may judge the
people</i>.&nbsp; Psal. l. 3, 4.&nbsp; <i>The Lord Jesus shall be
revealed from heaven</i>, <i>with his mighty angels in flaming
fire</i>, <i>taking vengeance on them that know not God</i>,
<i>and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ</i>.&nbsp; 2 Thes. i. 7, 8.&nbsp; <i>I beheld</i>, says
Daniel, <i>till the thrones were cast down</i>, <i>and the
Ancient of days did sit</i>, <i>whose garment was white as
snow</i>, <i>and the hair of his head like the pure wool</i>:
<i>his throne was like the fiery flame</i>, <i>and his wheels as
burning fire</i>.&nbsp; <i>A fiery stream issued</i>, <i>and came
forth from before him</i>: <i>thousand thousands ministered unto
him</i>, <i>and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
him</i>: <i>the judgment was set</i>, <i>and the books were
opened</i>.&nbsp; Dan. vii. 9, 10.</p>
<p>These are some of those sublime descriptions, which the
inspired writers give us of that period, in which every
circumstance that is grand, terrible, and august, shall conspire
to render it <i>the great and terrible day of the Lord</i>, Joel,
ii. 31, <i>the great day of his wrath</i>, Rev. vi. 17, the
general assize.&nbsp; If we contemplate the dignity of the Judge,
the splendor and multitude of his retinue, the majesty of his
throne, the process and issue of the judgment, together with all
the <a name="page345"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
345</span>circumstances that shall precede, attend, and follow,
his glorious appearing;&mdash;if we take into consideration
either the goodness or the severity, the wrath or the mercy, the
destruction or the redemption, the felicity or the woes, which
shall be respectively dispensed in this important period, have we
not reason to cry out, <i>who shall be able to stand before this
Holy Lord God</i>?</p>
<p>Consider, what a <i>Judge</i> we have to meet!&mdash;one of
infinite dignity; for he is the <i>King of glory</i>, Psal. xxiv.
7; <i>the great God our Saviour</i>, Tit. ii. 13; <i>the mighty
God the everlasting Father</i>, Isa. ix. 6; <i>King of kings and
Lord of lords</i>, Rev. xix. 16; <i>the Lord of hosts
himself</i>, Isa. viii. 13, 14; compared with 1 Pet. ii. 8.&nbsp;
<i>The true God</i>.&nbsp; 1 John, v. 20.&mdash;A Judge as much
transcending in dignity all earthly judges, as the heavens
surpass in glory the earth, or the sun in the firmament, the
twinkling stars, which all disappear, when he riseth.&mdash;A
Judge, at whose footstool the kings of the earth shall prostrate
themselves in either cheerful or compelled adoration; and, before
whose tribunal, judges themselves shall stand, and be
judged.&nbsp; A Judge, whose eye is so keen, as with one glance
to survey the universe; to pervade the thickest darkness; to
penetrate the depths of hell; and to search the heart; whose arm
is irresistible; and whose power neither men nor <a
name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 346</span>devils can
control.&nbsp; He shall be seated on a <i>great white throne</i>;
<i>white</i> in unspotted, unbribed, uncorrupted administration
of justice, from whence nothing can issue but purity, equity,
wisdom, and truth; and <i>great</i>, as being reared on the ruins
of all earthly thrones, and as forming the magnificent seat of
him, who is <i>the Most High God</i>, <i>possessor</i> and
arbiter <i>of heaven and earth</i>.&nbsp; Gen. xiv. 19.&nbsp;
<i>Thy throne</i>, <i>O God</i>! <i>is for ever and
ever</i>.&nbsp; Heb. i. 8.</p>
<p>What <i>attendants</i> shall grace his advent!&nbsp; Countless
myriads, a multitude, which no man can number, of saints and
angels bearing the <i>harps of God</i>, and decorated with crowns
of gold; all ambitious to be of his train; all vying with sacred
emulation, who shall tune their harps to the sweetest notes, and
exert their voices in loudest harmony, to the praise of Emmanuel;
and all joining, without a single discordant string, in one grand
and unanimous hallelujah, <i>To him that loved us and washed us
from our sins in his own blood</i>, <i>and hath made us kings and
priests unto God</i>, <i>to him be glory and dominion for ever
and ever</i>, Amen.&nbsp; Rev. i. 5, 6.&nbsp; <i>Worthy is the
Lamb that was slain</i>, <i>to receive power</i>, <i>and
riches</i>, <i>and wisdom</i>, <i>and strength</i>, <i>and
honor</i>, <i>and glory</i>, <i>and blessing</i>.&nbsp; Rev. v.
xii.</p>
<p>What <i>signs</i> shall announce his arrival!&nbsp; On earth
distress of nations, with perplexity; men&rsquo;s <a
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>hearts
failing them for fear&mdash;wars and rumours of
wars&mdash;earthquakes in divers countries&mdash;pestilence and
famine&mdash;all nature thrown into universal convulsions,
dreadful pangs that presage her approaching dissolution&mdash;the
earth shaken to its centre, and sea horribly agitated&mdash;the
heavens wrapped together like a parchment scroll, and passing
away with a great noise&mdash;the elements melting with fervent
heat; while the heavens and the earth are in one general
flame&mdash;the sun turned into darkness, being utterly eclipsed
by the overpowering lustre of the Sun of Righteousness; and the
moon into blood&mdash;the stars falling, as when the untimely
fruit of a fig-tree are thrown down by the wind&mdash;the
tremendous blast of the trump of God, so loud as to pierce the
caverns of the earth and the depths of the sea, to sound an alarm
in the abyss of hell, and carry an awakening summons through the
regions of the dead&mdash;the grave and <i>hades</i> resigning
their respective charge&mdash;gaping tombs, and parting seas
giving up their dead&mdash;bodies that slept for thousands of
years in a bed of dust, roused at the Archangel&rsquo;s voice, to
sleep no more; and re-united to immortal souls, their ancient
mates, all thronging to the tribunal of <span
class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
<p>See the <span class="smcap">Judge</span> himself enthroned! a
mixture of majesty and mercy, of vengeance and love, <a
name="page348"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 348</span>seated on
his brow;&mdash;the clouds his chariot, and the heavens his
canopy; while rocks and mountains flee before his face!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His lightnings flash, his thunders roll,<br
/>
How welcome to the faithful soul!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Millions attend his bar.&nbsp; Men, angels, devils, all
receive the summons, to await his decisive sentence.&nbsp; Adam
and his numerous posterity, Lucifer and his apostate train, and
all the angels who kept not their first estate, compose the awful
levee.&nbsp; The righteous fly swifter than the wind or the rapid
lightning, to meet their Lord in the air; devils and the wicked,
like criminals in chains dragged from their cells, are compelled,
though reluctant, to appear at his tribunal.&nbsp; <i>Small and
great stand before God</i>; <i>the books are opened</i>; Rev. xx.
12; the judgment begins; the grand transaction that is to decide
the fate of the world goes on, till at last sentence is passed,
<i>Come ye blessed</i>, or <i>Depart ye cursed</i>; and then,
upon the one hand, are heard doleful cries, tumultuous
lamentations, bitter weepings, that bespeak guilt and despair;
but upon the other, the triumphant songs of elect angels and
redeemed sinners, rending the heavens with applausive shouts and
acclamations in honor of the Judge; and with a voice, louder than
the noise of many waters, and more harmonious, <a
name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 349</span>than that
which celebrated the creation of all things, shouting <span
class="smcap">Salvation</span> <i>to our</i> <span
class="smcap">God</span> <i>who sitteth upon the throne</i>,
<i>and unto the LAMB</i>!</p>
<p>And must we <i>meet</i> this glorious, this tremendous Judge
of heaven and earth?&nbsp; We must.&nbsp; <i>Every eye shall see
him</i>; every knee shall bow to him; every ear shall be witness
to his decisive sentence; and every tongue confess, either with
cheerful and voluntary acknowledgment, or with forced and
irresistible conviction, that he is God.&nbsp; The people of his
grace shall see him, and kindle into rapture at the sight; shall
meet him, and find their heaven of heavens in the
interview.&nbsp; <i>They</i> shall meet him, to grace his
triumphs, and adorn his mediatorial crown, as jewels, of an
immense purchase, of infinite value, of unfading lustre.&nbsp;
The day of Messiah&rsquo;s second appearing will be his grand
coronation day; whereon, in the presence of admiring and
applauding millions, the <i>crown of salvation</i>, that crown of
crowns, shall be unanimously, publicly, and solemnly placed on
the head of King <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>; and every
voice shall shout, <i>Worthy is the Lamb</i>.&nbsp; Oh! that each
of <i>us</i> may bear some humble part in that immortal song!
some humble office in that great solemnity!</p>
<p>But <i>who</i>, among the wicked, <i>may abide the day of his
coming</i>; <i>and who shall stand</i>, <i>when he </i><a
name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
350</span><i>appeareth</i>?&nbsp; Mal. iii. 2.&nbsp; <i>For
behold the day cometh</i>, <i>that shall burn as an oven</i>; and
all the <span class="GutSmall">PROUD</span>, yea, and <i>all
that</i> <span class="GutSmall">DO WICKEDLY</span>, <i>shall be
stubble</i>, <i>and the day that cometh shall burn them up</i>,
<i>saith the lord of Hosts</i>, <i>that it shall leave them
neither root nor branch</i>.&nbsp; Mal. iv. 1.&nbsp; O what a
meeting will take place between the Judge, and those, who once
refused to acknowledge him as their Saviour and their King!&nbsp;
He <i>will meet them as a bear bereaved of her whelps</i>, <i>and
devour them as a lion</i>; Hos. xiii. 8; and they shall meet him,
as the briers and thorns, the flame that consumeth them.&nbsp;
<i>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
GOD</i>.&nbsp; In the character of the <i>Lion of the tribe of
Judah</i>, his advent will be tremendous: but it is <i>the wrath
of the</i> <span class="smcap">Lamb</span>, of the once-wounded,
rejected, persecuted, blasphemed, and injured <span
class="smcap">Lamb</span>, that will be most insufferably
dreadful; and it is from <i>that</i>, they will earnestly solicit
<i>mountains and rocks to hide them</i>, as a shelter from his
indignation.&nbsp; Rev. vi. 16.&nbsp; But, rocks and mountains
will be no veil from his all-seeing eye; no covert from his
Almighty arm; no obstruction to the shafts of his
vengeance.&nbsp; He will find them out though they make their bed
in hell; will pursue and overtake them, though they take the
wings of the morning, and flee to the uttermost parts of the
earth or sea; and <a name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
351</span>bring them down, though they make their nest in the
stars.&nbsp; And who can conceive how fearful that meeting must
be, when the parties are, rebellious mortals and a holy
God;&mdash;potsherds of the earth, and the Creator of all worlds!
worms, and Omnipotence!</p>
<p>Since, then, there will be a certain and swiftly approaching
interview between God and sinners, at the solemn hour of death;
and a more awful and decisive one, at the general assize: O how
deeply incumbent it is upon all, to prepare for both!&nbsp; But,
are you ready?&nbsp; Should death call, or God-Messiah descend to
judgment; would you be found in circumstances of security and
preparation?&nbsp; Ask your <i>hearts</i>.&nbsp; Are there no
guilty misgivings there?&nbsp; Ask your <i>lives</i>.&nbsp; Are
they such as correspond with the temper of persons, looking out
for, and hastening unto, the coming of the day of God?&nbsp; Ask
<i>conscience</i>.&nbsp; Sprinkled from the evil of guilt by the
blood of Christ, does it witness to your salvation? or loaded
with sin, and fraught with pollution, does it proclaim you the
subject of misery, and the heir of hell, and bear a loud
testimony to your condemnation?&nbsp; Ask the <i>word of
God</i>.&nbsp; Will your hearts and lives bear to be tried by
that touchstone of truth?&nbsp; If you profess Christianity; are
you <i>Bible</i> Christians?&nbsp; If you think you are sound <a
name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 352</span>in the
truth; will you bear to be probed?&nbsp; If you shrink from this
examination; is there not cause to fear, that there is some
latent sore you wish to conceal? some morbid part, you are
unwilling to be touched even with a gentle hand, though it is
festering deep, and spreading wide, and threatens death
everlasting?&nbsp; You may <i>think</i> you <i>are prepared</i>,
when you <i>are not</i>.&nbsp; The thought, in such a case,
arises from a spiritual mortification, that deadens the
conscience, and deprives it of feeling.&nbsp; And a supposition
of safety, where there is no scriptural ground to warrant it, is
only the reverie of a sick man, or the chimera of one that
dreameth.&nbsp; That you may not be deceived, or flattered, in a
point of such vast moment; let us now consider,</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; What kind of <i>preparation</i> it is incumbent upon
sinners to make, in the prospect of an interview with God at
death, and in the day of judgment.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; A <i>gracious</i> preparation; or, a preparation
through the inherent efficacy, and transforming influence of
<i>divine grace</i>.&nbsp; The nature of man is so depraved, and
all the faculties of the soul are so alienated from the life of
God, that a divine and supernatural power is absolutely requisite
to the restoration of that image, which sin effaced; to the
recovery of that happiness, <a name="page353"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 353</span>which man, as a transgressor, has
forfeited; to the implantation of those fruits of righteousness,
which were eradicated by the fall; and to the possession of
<i>that</i> divine and gracious &ldquo;<i>thing</i>, <i>which
</i><span class="GutSmall"><i>BY NATURE</i></span><i> man</i>
<span class="GutSmall">CANNOT HAVE</span>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation353"></a><a href="#footnote353"
class="citation">[353]</a>&nbsp; For, &ldquo;the condition of
man, after the fall of <i>Adam</i>, is such, that he cannot turn
and prepare himself by his <i>own natural strength</i> and good
works, to faith, and calling upon God: wherefore we have <i>no
power</i> to do good works pleasant and <i>acceptable</i> to God,
without the <span class="GutSmall">GRACE</span> of God by Christ
<i>preventing</i> us, <i>that we may have</i> a good will, and
<i>working with</i> us, <i>when</i> we have that good
will.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus speaks Article X.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of free
will.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the XIIIth is equally strong and
express.&nbsp; &ldquo;Works done <i>before</i> the grace of
Christ, and the inspiration of his Spirit, are not pleasant to
God, forasmuch as they spring not of faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be urged, that &ldquo;these are the words of fallible
men.&rdquo;&nbsp; A poor evasive plea this.&nbsp; For though the
<i>words</i> be the composition of fallible men, yet the
sentiments are the truths of the infallible God: for the
scriptures declare that <i>the preparation of the heart in man
is</i> <span class="smcap">of the Lord</span>; Prov. xvi.
1.&nbsp; See also I Chron. xxix. 18; <a name="page354"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 354</span>that we <i>must be born again</i>,
John, iii. 7; that being <i>dead in trespasses and sins</i>, we
must be <i>quickened by God</i>, Ephes. ii. 1; that <i>no man can
come unto Christ</i>, <i>except the Father</i> <span
class="GutSmall">DRAW</span> <i>him</i>, John, vi. 44; that,
<i>if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ he is none of
his</i>, Rom. viii. 9; <i>that it is God who worketh in us</i>,
<i>to will and to do of his good pleasure</i>, Phil. xxii. 13;
and that, <i>without</i> (or &chi;&omega;&rho;&iota;&sigmaf;
severed from) <i>Christ we can do nothing</i>, but sin, and
err.&nbsp; John, xv. 5.&nbsp; The nature of man, since the fall,
is <i>depraved</i>: nothing but grace can rectify and renew
it.&nbsp; It is <i>disordered</i>: grace alone provides a
remedy.&nbsp; It is <i>polluted</i>: its innate defilement is
cleansed by grace.&nbsp; It is <i>unholy</i>: <i>the grace of
God</i>, <i>which bringeth</i> present <i>salvation</i>,
<i>teacheth us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts</i>.&nbsp;
Titus, iii. 12.&nbsp; It is <i>debased</i> by sin: nothing can
ennoble or exalt it, but all-sufficient grace.&nbsp; It is
<i>weak</i> and <i>impotent</i>: grace alone can strengthen and
fortify it against temptation.&nbsp; It is <i>rebellious</i>:
grace controls and captivates its most stubborn opposition, and
makes its powers passive, and flexible.&nbsp; Human nature is
<i>barren</i>: and nothing but all-conquering grace can subdue
its sterility.&nbsp; It is grace that <i>breaks up the fallow
ground</i>; softens the soil; sows the seed; cherishes it, when
sown; makes it spring; brings it to maturity; blesses it with
sunshines and showers; defends it from nipping frosts <a
name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 355</span>and
scorching heat; and crowns the once-barren and stubborn soil with
a rich harvest of fruit.&nbsp; It is grace that makes that
wonderful change, so beautifully described in Isa. xxxv.
1&ndash;9.&nbsp; <i>The wilderness and the solitary place shall
be glad for them</i>: <i>and the desert shall rejoice and blossom
as the rose</i>: <i>it shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even
with joy and singing</i>.&mdash;<i>For in the wilderness shall
waters break out</i>, <i>and streams in the desert</i>.&nbsp;
<i>And the parched ground shall become a pool</i>, <i>and the
thirsty land</i>, <i>springs of water</i>: in the <i>habitation
of dragons</i> (<i>fierce</i>, untamed, impoisoning lusts, that
make a carnal mind to resemble the haunt of venomous beasts)
<i>where each lay</i>, <i>shall be grass with reeds and
rushes</i>.&nbsp; <i>And an highway shall be there</i>, <i>and a
way</i>, <i>and it shall be called the way of Holiness</i>.</p>
<p>Such is that gracious work which renews the soul, and makes it
meet for a meeting with God; which makes all <i>old things pass
away and every thing become new</i>; 2 Cor. v. 7; and without
which, man is indisposed to the ways of righteousness, and unfit
to perform any thing acceptable to God.&nbsp; O that you may be
enabled to determine whether or not this work has been wrought in
you!&nbsp; Trust not to poor, naked morality; that meagre,
superficial thing, which unsanctified immoral Pharisees make
their all.&nbsp; Morality only skins over the wound; but grace <a
name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 356</span>effects a
radical cure.&nbsp; Morality strikes at outward branches; but
grace alone can lay the axe to the root of corruption.&nbsp;
Morality may give a specious white-washing to a sepulchre, or a
gilded varnish to a statue; but grace alone can cleanse from
inward foulness, turn rottenness and death into life and purity,
and convert dead men&rsquo;s bones into living members of
Christ.&nbsp; Morality confines its attention only to the
cleansing of the <i>streams</i>: but grace, like
<i>Elisha&rsquo;s</i> wonder-working <i>cruse of salt</i>, goes
up to the <i>springs of water</i>, and pours its primary, its
salutary, influence <i>there</i>.&nbsp; 2 Kings, ii. 20,
21.&nbsp; Morality gives the <i>appearance</i> only of that, of
which grace makes the reality.&nbsp; Morality assumes the name of
religion; but grace forms its nature.&nbsp; Morality may make an
useful member of society, but grace alone can make a faithful
member of Christ.&nbsp; Human power can accomplish a doctrinal
speculatist, or constitute a pharisaical formalist; but God that
made the world, must make a <i>Christian</i>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The preparation requisite, is such, as demands the
solemn and unreserved dedication of the heart and life to the
service and honor of God; or such a devotion of all we have and
are, to his glory, as bespeaks the purity of the principles by
which we are to be governed; the power and sincerity of the
motives, by which <a name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
357</span>we are to be actuated; and the great importance of the
<i>end</i> we are to have in view.</p>
<p>God has an indisputable right to all we possess; because all
we have is the effect of his power, and the result of his
unmerited bounty.&nbsp; The <i>heart</i> is more especially his
claim; because he first made it himself, and, when fallen,
redeemed it with the blood of his Son.&nbsp; <i>My Son give me
thy heart</i>, Prov. xxiii. 26, is therefore his most reasonable
and gracious demand.&nbsp; To give it to any thing else, save to
its original Proprietor and Redeemer, is black ingratitude, is
palpable idolatry: and to pretend devotion, when the heart is
withheld, is hypocrisy and dissimulation.&nbsp; Give God any
thing, and keep back the heart, and you virtually give him
nothing, or present him with an abomination.&nbsp; <i>He is a
Spirit</i>, <i>and they who worship him</i>, <i>must worship him
in spirit and in truth</i>.&nbsp; John, iv. 24.&nbsp; The most
tedious round of duties, the most punctual and ceremonious
attendance upon forms, are but so many elaborate modes of
affronting Jehovah, if <i>the heart be not right with God</i>;
and so many delusive methods to conceal a latent malady, which is
open to the eye of omniscience, as the foulest insincerity, and
the rankest pride.&nbsp; They who honor the Lord with
lip-service, or draw nigh to him in <a name="page358"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 358</span>mere formality, are they who
<i>trust in lying words</i> and espouse a delusion; especially
when crying out, <i>The temple of the Lord</i>, <i>the temple of
the Lord</i>, <i>are these</i>.&nbsp; Jer. vii. 4.</p>
<p>But how few consider this with becoming seriousness and
attention!&nbsp; Hurried on in the circle of dissipation, and
driven impetuously forward by the torrent of popular example,
multitudes possess neither leisure nor inclination, to examine
the grounds of their profession, or to compare their hearts and
lives with the word of God.&nbsp; As if religion had nothing to
do with the <i>heart</i>, they only profess with their lips,
what, alas! is strongly reprobated by the current of their
affections and the tenor of their lives.&nbsp; The lusts of the
flesh, the lusts of the eye, and the pride of life, are their
favorite idols: and to sacrifice to these, not to the Lord of
Hosts, is the wish, the desire, the ultimate resolution of their
hearts.&nbsp; To such, an inspired Apostle says, <i>Ye adulterers
and adulteresses</i>, <i>know ye not</i>, <i>that the friendship
of the world is enmity with God</i>.&nbsp; James, iv. 4.&nbsp;
They attend public worship; but while they are visible in their
pews to the eye of man, their real selves, their hearts, appear
to omniscience to be pursuing their vanities, and wandering
immeasurably far from God, when they <a name="page359"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 359</span>should be approaching him in the
most solemn and intimate communion: so that in the very act of
pretending to worship him, they mock him most.&nbsp; Their
&ldquo;week&rsquo;s preparation&rdquo; is hurried over with the
rapidity of a school-boy repeating his task; only with not so
much attention, nor with equal fear; and, while they feel
religion to be perfect bondage, and go through it as a drudgery,
they nevertheless depend upon their lame performances for
acceptance, and so make their very sin and abomination their
Saviour.</p>
<p>And is this the preparation the scriptures require?&nbsp; Is
this giving the heart to God?&nbsp; Are such persons consistent
worshippers of that God, who is a <i>Spirit</i>?&nbsp; Can these
be said to be preparing to meet the Lord?&nbsp; Are they at all
ready to go forth at the coming of the bridegroom?&nbsp;
No.&nbsp; A spiritual infirmity, deeper than that lameness, which
prevented <i>Mephibosheth</i> from going out to meet King David,
incapacitates, and indisposes them totally for the advent of the
King of kings.&nbsp; Their preparation, like the ceremony of a
funeral, is nothing but the pageantry of <i>the dead</i>; and the
decorations of a breathless corpse carried in pompous procession
to be food for worms in the grave, exhibit too striking a
representation of that unanimated <a name="page360"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 360</span>and lifeless formality, which, with
all its gaudy trappings, is but the <i>corpse</i> of religion,
and leads to the chambers of everlasting death.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; An habitual <i>watchfulness</i> of spirit, that
implies diligence, solicitude, fidelity, prayer, holiness, is
absolutely required of those, who would wish to meet God with
joy.&nbsp; This watchfulness, in scripture, is contrasted to
sloth, inaction, unfaithfulness, inordinate care,
worldly-mindedness, and carnal security.&nbsp; It is compared to
that circumspection and fidelity which should mark the conduct of
a servant, entrusted with the care of a household, and obliged by
the nature of his office, as well as the injunctions of his
master, to manage every thing in his absence with wisdom, and to
prepare for his return; and to that wakeful diligence, by which a
house is guarded against the depredations of nightly
robbers.&nbsp; <i>Let your loins be girded about</i>, <i>and your
lights burning</i>, <i>and ye yourselves like unto men that wait
for their Lord</i>, <i>when he will return from the
wedding</i>.&nbsp; <i>Blessed are those servants</i>, <i>whom the
Lord</i>, <i>when he cometh</i>, <i>shall find
watching</i>.&nbsp; <i>And this know</i>, <i>that if the good man
of the house had known what hour the thief would come</i>, <i>he
would have watched</i>, <i>and not have suffered his house to be
broken through</i>.&nbsp; Luke, xii. 35&ndash;39.&nbsp; The
contrary temper of unwatchfulness is described <a
name="page361"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 361</span>in the
character of an unfaithful, quarrelsome, disobedient, and drunken
servant, who takes occasion to riot and revel, from the delay of
his master&rsquo;s returning home.&nbsp; <i>But</i>, <i>and if
that servant say in his heart</i>, <i>my Lord delayeth his
coming</i>, <i>and shall begin to beat the men-servants and
maidens</i>, <i>and to eat and drink</i>, <i>and to be
drunken</i>, <i>the Lord of that servant will come in a day when
he looketh not for him</i>, <i>and at an hour when he is not
aware</i>, <i>and will cut him in sunder</i>, <i>and will appoint
him his portion with the unbelievers</i>.&nbsp; Luke, xii. 45,
46.&nbsp; And in all those instances, the principal argument to
urge the necessity of watching, is founded on the uncertainty of
the time of our Lord&rsquo;s arrival.&nbsp; <i>Be ye therefore
ready</i>, <i>for the Son of man cometh at an hour</i>, <i>when
ye think not</i>.&nbsp; Luke, xii. 40.&nbsp; <i>The day of the
Lord will come as a thief in the night</i>.&nbsp; 2 Pet. iii.
10.</p>
<p>The watchfulness, therefore, recommended by our Lord, and
implied in the text, comprehends an habitual spirit of prayer;
hence the exhortation, <i>Watch and pray&mdash;habitual
sobriety</i>; <i>Watch and be sober</i>; Thes. v.
6;&mdash;holiness in conversation; <i>Set a watch before my
mouth</i>; Psal. cxli. 3;&mdash;a patient, yet ardent expectation
of the Lord&rsquo;s arrival; and a cautious avoidance of every
care, of every pleasure, and <a name="page362"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 362</span>of every entanglement, which might
ensnare the heart, captivate the senses, and immerse the
affections in sloth and self-indulgence.&nbsp; All which is
enjoined in that concise but most solemn and comprehensive
exhortation of the Son of God, <i>What I say unto you</i>, <i>I
say unto all</i>.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Watch</span>!&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">ON THE DEATH
OF MR. I. A.</span></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>He shall enter into
peace</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Isaiah</span>, lvii.
2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great and irreversible decree
of Heaven, respecting the whole human race, is, &ldquo;Dust thou
art, and unto dust thou shalt return.&rdquo;&nbsp; This sentence,
originally pronounced upon the transgression of the first man,
evidently included also his whole posterity to the end of
time.&nbsp; It has already received its solemn execution upon the
generations that are past: we see with our eyes, its effects in
the multitudes, that are daily passing from time to eternity: nor
shall its influence cease, until the wide-extended dominion of
death be destroyed, and mortality swallowed up of life.</p>
<p>The divine appointment, through which the grave becomes the
common receptacle of all <a name="page364"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 364</span>men, is not more awful, than it is
<i>just</i>: for, &ldquo;the <i>wages</i> of sin is
<i>death</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Man <i>deserves</i> to die, because he
hath <i>sinned</i>.&nbsp; Hence, there ariseth a necessary and
inevitable connexion between our origin and our end.&nbsp; So
that, if we wish to trace the innumerable calamities attendant
upon death, to their source; we shall soon find, that they all
originate from <span class="GutSmall">SIN</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;As
by one man <span class="GutSmall">SIN</span> entered into the
world, and <i>death</i> by sin, and so death passed upon
<i>all</i> men, for that all have <i>sinned</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Rom. v. 12.&nbsp; It is sin that hath brought universal disorder
into the natural and spiritual world.&nbsp; It hath sown the
seeds of mortality in the human frame; hath filled the heart with
alienation from God; and rendered body and soul obnoxious to the
sentence of everlasting separation from the kingdom of
heaven.&nbsp; Sin hath given death his sting; and furnished that
king of terrors with his formidable message and tremendous
appearance.&nbsp; It hath opened the horrors of the tomb, and
expanded wide the mouth of hell.&nbsp; It hath armed the law with
a curse, more to be dreaded than death; hath given the sword of
justice its sharpest edge; and hath awakened the indignation of
that God, who is as a consuming fire.&nbsp; It is the great bar
of separation between the creature and the Creator; and is that
moral evil, which, when finished, brings forth death, <a
name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>temporal
and eternal.&nbsp; It brought a flood of waters upon the old
world; was the cause of Sodom&rsquo;s destruction; and will, at
last, bring a deluge of fire upon the world that now is.</p>
<p>In a review of those innumerable evils, of which, even death
is not the greatest, it will be incumbent upon us, therefore, to
keep our eye fixed on the origin of them all, <span
class="GutSmall">SIN</span>.&nbsp; Hereby we shall be able to
vindicate the righteous procedure of God, even when we behold him
sending death to pull down the beautiful fabric, which his own
hands had made; and opening the grave, as the sad and silent
repository of his own curious workmanship.&nbsp; When we reflect,
that it is <i>sin</i>, that hath produced this melancholy change,
and that this evil is found upon us; the reflection will help to
restrain the extravagance of grief, and to suppress that
predominancy of discontented repining, which often makes sinners
fly in the face of God, and charge him foolishly.&nbsp; For, if
death be not duly considered and acknowledged as the desert and
wages of sin, I can easily conceive that, for want of such humble
consideration, sinners may be led to arraign the dispensations of
the Most High; to charge unerring wisdom with foolishness;
infinite justice with unrighteousness; and mercy itself with
cruelty.&nbsp; But, when once sin is viewed, in its <i>damning
nature</i>, its <i>dreadful</i> <a name="page366"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 366</span><i>effects</i>, and <i>just
deserts</i>; the discovery will produce submission to the divine
will, under the most severe dispensations.&nbsp; It will make us
&ldquo;put our mouths in the dust,&rdquo; in silent acquiescence
in the wise and sovereign disposals of Heaven.&nbsp; Or, if we
open them, it will only be to confess, that &ldquo;the Lord is
righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his
works.&rdquo;&nbsp; By attentively considering the nature of sin
and the manner of its introduction, in order to account for the
origin of all the evils that prevail in the natural and spiritual
world, and to vindicate eternal Providence, and justify the ways
of God with men; we shall hereby also possess the consequent
advantage of beholding, in its most glorious point of view, the
inestimable <span class="GutSmall">REMEDY</span> for sin, by the
death and resurrection of the <span class="smcap">Lord Jesus
Christ</span>.&nbsp; And, if the former considerations may be
deemed sufficient to work in the heart patient submission, and
unrepining acquiescence in the dispensations of Jehovah;
<i>this</i> will inspire it with a hope blooming, and full of
immortality.&nbsp; If reflections on the demerit of sin can stop
the mouth in silence in the dust; <i>this</i> will open it in
bursts of praise, and glowing effusions of gratitude and
admiration.&nbsp; <i>Sin</i> is redemption&rsquo;s advantageous
<i>foil</i>.&nbsp; And as the variegated colors of the rainbow
shine with greatest beauty on the blackest cloud: <a
name="page367"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 367</span>so, the
malignity of sin, and the gloom of death, tend proportionably to
set off the glory of the Saviour, and to give additional lustre
to that bright manifestation of life and immortality, which are
brought to light by the gospel.</p>
<p>This chain of thought, if pursued, will necessarily lead us,
not only to behold the riches of divine grace and the out beaming
of all the divine attributes, rendered eventually more glorious
even by the intrusion of the most horrid evil; but also to
consider death itself as the portal to eternal life.&nbsp; This
consideration will immediately fix the heart in delightful
meditation on the great work of <span
class="GutSmall">HIM</span>, who came &ldquo;to put away sin by
the sacrifice of himself, and through death to destroy him that
had the power of death, that is, the Devil.&rdquo;&nbsp; Heb. ii.
14.&nbsp; And here such a bright scene will present itself to the
eye of contemplative faith, as shall dispel the horrors of the
tomb; gild with joy and triumph the shadow of death; and enable
us to derive wisdom and consolation, even from the solemn
apparatus of a funeral.&nbsp; Here we shall be led to meditate on
the great and glorious end of the Redeemer&rsquo;s incarnation,
and the wonderful effects of his mediatorial undertaking.&nbsp;
We shall behold him triumphing over sin in his cross, and leading
captivity captive by his glorious resurrection.&nbsp; Bereaving
death of its <a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
368</span>sting, and embalming the regions of the dead by his own
burial;&mdash;shutting the mouth of Tophet, and opening to his
people the gates of everlasting bliss; and still going forth
conquering and to conquer, till sin, Satan, the world, and death,
are made his footstool.</p>
<p>These contemplations will suggest the grand preservative
against immoderate grief; and administer that healing balm for
woe, which the heavy calamities of this mortal life require; and
without which, the pressure of them would be insupportable.&nbsp;
Whoever is acquainted with the great doctrines of the gospel, and
the saving influence of them upon the heart, is the only person
duly prepared for the arrival of those alarming incidents, which
often give such a vehement shock to the feelings of human
nature.&nbsp; And, as no event whatever more sensibly touches the
heart, than that which bereaves us of our earthly friends;
consequently nothing can bear up the mind under such losses, but
that which administers a ground of consolation, adequate to the
cause of our sorrow.&nbsp; This, divine revelation can do.&nbsp;
It assures us, that &ldquo;blessed are the dead which die in the
Lord:&rdquo; that, though &ldquo;one event happeneth to the
righteous and the wicked,&rdquo; yet that the souls of the former
are &ldquo;taken away from the evils&rdquo; of time, and made
possessors of the glories of eternity: that, <a
name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 369</span>therefore,
&ldquo;we should not sorrow&rdquo; immoderately, as others which
have no hope, but, &ldquo;if we believe that Jesus died and rose
again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Thes. iv. 14.</p>
<p>Truths these, which brighten the prospect of even a dread
eternity, and strip death of every thing really terrifying.&nbsp;
Under a firm persuasion of their credibility, we may give up our
friends, without any reluctance, into the icy arms of death: and
when depositing their precious remains in the cold and gloomy
recess of the tomb, may rejoice in lively hope of that happy
resurrection-morn, when the sound of the last trumpet shall
awaken them from their slumber in the dust, and call them from
their long confinement into life and glorious immortality.&nbsp;
So that, while a disconsolate parent is bedewing the corpse of a
beloved child with his tears, or one friend is bemoaning the loss
of another, crying, &ldquo;Ah, my brother!&rdquo; it is
sufficient at any time to repress the impetuous current of grief,
and admit the soothing remonstrances of <i>hope</i> and
<i>resignation</i>, to reflect, that deceased friends are not
lost, but gone before; and, that if they have died in the Lord,
our loss is their everlasting gain.&nbsp; But here let us</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Examine the character of those, who shall be thus
favored: and <a name="page370"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
370</span></p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Consider the nature and extent of their happiness
implied in the terms <i>entering into peace</i>.&mdash;After I
have gone through these two heads, I shall, then,</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Endeavour to suggest some serious reflections,
particularly adapted to the consideration of young persons, and
not unworthy the solemn attention of the aged.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; We are to examine the character of those who shall be
so favored, as, after death, to be translated to glory.</p>
<p>They are described, in the very first verse of the chapter,
from whence I have selected the text, under the general character
of &ldquo;the righteous.&rdquo;&nbsp; A denomination this, which
comprehends their manner of acceptance before God, and the nature
of their walk before men.&nbsp; But, as mistakes respecting these
two points are not more frequent, than they are fatal, permit me
to state this part of the subject, under the following scriptural
observations.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; We can only determine what is righteous or
unrighteous by the test of God&rsquo;s holy law.&nbsp; Every
thing that is repugnant to this perfect rule, is unrighteousness;
and that which is commensurate with its sacred requisitions, is
righteousness.&nbsp; In the former branch of the definition,
there is implied every <i>kind</i> and every <i>degree</i> of
contrariety to the law: as the latter <a name="page371"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 371</span>comprehends universality and
perfection of obedience.&nbsp; From hence it must, at first view,
appear, that although there is, allowedly, a deeper
<i>malignity</i> in some sins than in others, yet that
<i>every</i> transgression of the law is sin, and merits death:
and that, therefore, no <i>medium</i> can be found between
righteousness and unrighteousness: for the scripture asserts,
that &ldquo;<i>all</i> unrighteousness is sin:&rdquo; so that,
before the popish distinction between sins <i>venial</i> and sins
<i>mortal</i> can be admitted, it must first be demonstrated that
there is a middle something between righteousness and
unrighteousness, which neither keeps the law nor breaks it; that
there are some sins, which in their nature are not damning; and
are pardonable, <i>merely</i> because they are <i>little</i> in
point of aggravation.&nbsp; But, that absurdities of this nature
are as contrary to sound divinity, as they are repugnant to right
reason, it is evident, because, &ldquo;the <i>wages</i> of
<i>sin</i>,&rdquo; of every sin, &ldquo;is death;&rdquo; and the
holy law of God, without leaving vain man to judge for himself in
a matter of so great importance, stamps a <i>curse</i> upon every
failure in obedience, whether great or small; saying,
&ldquo;<i>Cursed</i> is every one that continueth not in <span
class="GutSmall">ALL</span> things written in the book of the law
to do them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; As every transgression of the law is sin,
consequently, that can only be denominated <a
name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
372</span><i>righteousness</i>, which implies a full conformity
to all its precepts.&nbsp; Under this term, therefore, are
comprehended <i>purity of principle</i>, <i>perfection</i>,
<i>universality</i>, <i>and spirituality</i> of obedience.&nbsp;
1. That any single act of an external nature can possess no claim
to righteousness, unless the <i>principle</i> be intrinsically
good, is evident; because, St. Paul supposes it possible to
&ldquo;give one&rsquo;s goods to feed the poor,&rdquo; and to
suffer martyrdom, and yet to do both from a false
principle.&nbsp; The nature of fruits is determinable, not by
their <i>appearance</i>, but by the state of the tree: and fruits
of righteousness can only grow upon a righteous stock.&nbsp; As
the <i>heart</i> is the seat of principle, <i>that</i> must
consequently possess &ldquo;truth in the inward parts,&rdquo; in
order to communicate purity to its desires, purposes, and
aims.&nbsp; If the streams are pure, they must issue from a pure
fountain.&nbsp; So that there must be spotless purity of heart to
give existence to a righteous act.&nbsp; 2. There is included in
the term <i>righteousness</i>, not only immaculate purity in
principle, but likewise perfection and <i>universality</i> in the
act.&nbsp; As every branch of the law is equally holy, just, and
good; therefore every precept of it hath an equal demand of
obedience, &ldquo;For, he that said, Do not commit adultery, said
also, Do not kill.&nbsp; Now, if thou commit no adultery, yet if
thou kill, thou art become a transgressor <a
name="page373"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 373</span>of the
law.&rdquo;&nbsp; James, ii. 11.&nbsp; Man is not left to pick
and choose, according to his own option, which of the
commandments he may think proper to keep, but is required, on
pain of death, to observe the <i>whole</i> law: for, if any
<i>one</i> precept could be dispensed with, so of course might
all.&nbsp; But &ldquo;whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet
offend in <span class="GutSmall">ONE</span> point, he is guilty
of <span class="GutSmall">ALL</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; James, ii.
10.&nbsp; 3. The righteousness which the law demands, must not
only respect the <i>letter</i>, but also the <i>spirit</i> of it;
for &ldquo;the law is <i>spiritual</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. vii.
14.&nbsp; By the spirituality of the law, the <i>thoughts</i> of
the <i>heart</i> come as much under its strict cognizance, as the
outward actions of the <i>life</i>.&nbsp; Thus the same precept,
which prohibits the act of adultery, equally condemns the
<i>lustful thought</i> and <i>lascivious glance</i>, as
violations of the seventh commandment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whosoever
<i>looketh</i> on a woman to lust after her, hath committed
adultery with her already in his heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mat. v.
28.&nbsp; And the same prohibition which, in its letter, condemns
the worshipping of images; gives, by its spirituality, the name
of <i>idolatry</i> to the inordinate love of any thing that robs
God of his right.&nbsp; Thus <i>covetousness</i> in the heart, or
the inordinate love of pleasure, will as effectually constitute
<i>idolatry</i>, in the eye of the law, as the most formal
prostration to graven images.&nbsp; So that the
<i>righteousness</i>, which <a name="page374"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 374</span>the law requires, includes a
conformity to its sanctions, as fully, in the <i>spirit</i>, as
in the <i>letter</i> of them; and as much to the <i>whole</i>, as
to a <i>single precept</i>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; From the foregoing considerations, it is plain, that
as righteousness consists in a fulfilment of the whole law,
according to the perfection, purity, and deep spirituality of its
commands; consequently he alone can be denominated a
<i>righteous</i> man, whose conduct is a literal transcript of
the above definition of righteousness.&nbsp; Or, in other words,
he is righteous <i>legally</i>, whose thoughts, words and
actions, can bear the rigorous examination of God&rsquo;s law;
whose heart is perfectly free from every wrong principle, and
every corrupt inclination; whose life exemplifies the whole
obedience of the law in its fullest extent; and who can therefore
challenge either the law or the law-giver to find <i>any sin</i>
in him.&nbsp; And, there is one ingredient more indispensably
requisite in the character of a man righteous, according to the
<i>law</i>; which is, <i>incessancy</i> of obedience.&nbsp; In
order to be justified by it, man must not only obey, but
<i>persevere</i> in obeying.&nbsp; Perfect obedience will not be
sufficient unless it be continued, and that to the end of
life.&nbsp; The righteousness of the law saith, &ldquo;The man
that doeth those things shall live by them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. x.
5.&nbsp; And its penal sanction <a name="page375"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 375</span>crieth, &ldquo;Cursed is every one
that <i>continueth</i> not in all things,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; And now, where is such a righteous character to be
found?&nbsp; The heart and life of Adam, indeed, previous to his
fall, literally exemplified it in its greatest perfection.&nbsp;
But since that melancholy event, there is an end of all human
righteousness.&nbsp; For &ldquo;the scripture concluding all
under sin,&rdquo; declareth that &ldquo;there is none
<i>righteous</i>, <i>no not one</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. iii.
10.&nbsp; A declaration, which equally affects Gentiles as well
as Jews, and places the fallen children of Adam upon an equal
footing, in point of justifying righteousness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every
mouth must now be stopped, and <span class="GutSmall">ALL THE
WORLD</span> become <span class="GutSmall">GUILTY</span> before
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. iii. 19.&nbsp; Man cannot justify
<i>himself</i>: for an attempt to do so would only &ldquo;prove
him perverse,&rdquo; and be an additional manifestation of his
unrighteousness.&nbsp; The <i>law</i> cannot justify him, because
&ldquo;it is weak through the <i>flesh</i>,&rdquo; or the
inherent corruption of human nature.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the deeds of
the law there shall no flesh be justified.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. iii.
20.&nbsp; For, &ldquo;if righteousness come by the
law&rdquo;&mdash;if a sinner could be justified by his obedience
to it&mdash;&ldquo;then Christ is dead in vain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gal.
ii. 21.&nbsp; This inability to justify, is not the effect of any
absolute weakness in the law itself, but is eventually occasioned
through the dreadful degeneracy of <a name="page376"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 376</span>human nature, styled in scripture,
&ldquo;the flesh.&rdquo;&nbsp; The law still retains as intrinsic
a power in itself to constitute righteous, as it ever did; and if
any man could be found capable of fulfilling its condition of
perfect obedience, it would not only justify him, but also
entitle him to glory, independent of the Son of God: for its
condition and promise are connected, when it says on this wise,
&ldquo;<i>Do</i> this, and <i>live</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
man&rsquo;s original guilt and practical disobedience, incurring
a double forfeiture of the promised reward, the law possesseth an
eventual incapacity of <i>making righteous</i>: and this is, what
the apostle says, &ldquo;the law could not do,&rdquo; Rom. viii.
3, or &tau;&omicron;
&alpha;&delta;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&nu;
&tau;&omicron;&upsilon; &nu;&omicron;&mu;&omicron;&upsilon; is,
the <i>impossibility of the law</i>.&nbsp; So that, whoever seeks
justification by it, seeks an <i>impossibility</i>; and by having
recourse to its obligation of perfect obedience, and failing
notwithstanding in a fulfilment of that obligation, he lays
himself open to the full force of its condemning sentence, its
penal sanctions, and tremendous curse.&nbsp; &ldquo;As many as
are of the works of the law, are under the <span
class="GutSmall">CURSE</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gal. iii., 10.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; But, since, according to numerous testimonies of
scripture; agreeably to the purity, spirituality, and
indispensable requirements of the law; and consistently with the
universal depravity of human nature; man cannot, without <a
name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 377</span>the highest
arrogance, and even blasphemy, lay any claim to personal merit:
how then is he to become <i>righteous</i>?&nbsp; This is an
inquiry of infinite importance; since it is declared, that
&ldquo;the <i>unrighteous</i> shall not inherit the kingdom of
God;&rdquo; and since, without an exemption from guilt and an
interest in a positive righteousness, man can have no scriptural
ground to hope for a deliverance from death or a title to life;
to expect the favor of God here, or to claim his kingdom
hereafter.&nbsp; In illustrating this point, it will be necessary
to consider, how a man&rsquo;s person may be righteous towards
God, and how his works may so justify his religious profession
before the world, as to vindicate his character from the
imputation of hypocrisy, and demonstrate the genuineness of his
faith.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; As to the manner, in which a sinner is to be made
righteous before God; since it has already been demonstrated, by
irrefragable proof from the scriptures of truth, as well as by
arguments deduced from the corruption of human nature, and the
sanctions and sentence of the law, that all obedience of the
sinner is insufficient towards his justification before the
majesty of heaven; nothing farther in a negative way need be
added, to corroborate, what is, indeed, in itself, so evident,
and incontrovertible.&nbsp; It may, however, be necessary to
quote a few scriptures, <a name="page378"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 378</span>in which two of the most illustrious
saints, in language of the deepest self-renunciation, disclaim
any the least pretensions to justification before the most High
and Holy God, howsoever they might esteem their conduct
justifiable before fallible creatures, like themselves.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Behold I am vile</span>!&rdquo; says
he, who was a mirror of patience, &ldquo;what shall I answer
thee?&rdquo;&nbsp; Job, xl. 4.&nbsp; &ldquo;How can man be <span
class="GutSmall">JUSTIFIED WITH GOD</span>?&rdquo; says the same
person, &ldquo;or how can he be clean that is born of a
woman?&nbsp; Behold even to the moon and it shineth not: yea the
stars are not pure in his sight; how much less man that is a
worm!&rdquo;&nbsp; Job, xxv. 4, 5.&nbsp; Hear how the man after
God&rsquo;s own heart trembleth at the thought of Jehovah&rsquo;s
entering into judgment with him, or any other creature.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities; O Lord, who
shall stand?&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. cxxx. 3.&nbsp; &ldquo;Enter not
into judgment with thy servant: for, in <span
class="GutSmall">THY</span> sight shall no man living be
justified.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal. cxliii. 2.&mdash;Passages these,
which are but few out of the multitudes that might be produced,
to demonstrate the impossibility of being justified in ourselves
before a heart-searching God, as well as the dreadful peril of
abiding the sentence and scrutiny of his righteous law.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; But how, then, can man stand before this holy Lord
God, and be constituted righteous in <a name="page379"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 379</span>his sight?&nbsp; This question
cannot better be answered than in the words of the XIth article
of the Church of England.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are accounted righteous
before God <i>only</i> for the merit of our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ, and <i>not</i> for our <i>own</i> works or
deservings.&rdquo;&nbsp; I quote this excellent article of our
church, not with any design of establishing its authority as
infallible and decisive, but merely because it affords a plain
and scriptural definition of the point in question, as well as
exhibits a striking proof, that our sentiments, on the mode of a
sinner&rsquo;s justification before God, are supported by the
venerable sanction of the Church of England: and I believe it
will satisfactorily appear, that it is not without scriptural
ground, that she requires of all her ministers, an unequivocal
and solemn subscription to this, as well as every other article
in the <i>thirty-nine</i>.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; According to our church, therefore, and the word of
God, with which, on this head, she perfectly accords, our
justifying righteousness is the meritorious work of Christ; which
consisteth in a perfect obedience to the law, and a full
satisfaction to divine justice; the one including what he
<i>did</i>, the other what he <i>suffered</i>; and both, in
inseparable connexion, constituting that glorious and
&ldquo;everlasting righteousness,&rdquo; which the Mediator hath
brought in, by his entire <a name="page380"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 380</span>obedience to the death of the
cross.&nbsp; This is called by our church, &ldquo;the
<i>merit</i>&rdquo; of Christ, because when the dignity of his
person is taken into consideration, it appears that an infinite
sufficiency is thereby communicated to his obedience, and every
part thereof; and that he possesseth an inherent power of
meriting for others, or of <i>constituting</i> others righteous,
as well as being righteous himself.&nbsp; This he can only do, as
being &ldquo;God over all, blessed for evermore.&rdquo;&nbsp;
For, if he had been a mere creature, though his righteousness
might be sufficient to justify himself, yet it could never have
transferred a power of justifying others: because, it is
repugnant both to reason and scripture, that <i>any created</i>
being, even the first-born seraph round the throne of God, should
not only merit for himself, but also possess a redundancy of
merits transferable to others.&nbsp; But that the Redeemer is
possessed of such a power, is evident from the words of the
apostle, &ldquo;By the obedience of one shall many <i>be made
righteous</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. v. 19.&nbsp; This argument
proves, therefore, that Christ is <i>very God</i>, as well as
very man: that there is a translation of merit infinitely
sufficient in a sinner&rsquo;s justification: and that the active
and passive obedience of the Mediator, is, through the infinite
dignity of his person, a <i>divine</i> righteousness.&nbsp; Hence
it is written, &ldquo;This is his name <a
name="page381"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 381</span>whereby he
shall be called, <span class="smcap">Jehovah our
righteousness</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jer. xxiii. 6.&nbsp; And
again, &ldquo;We are made <i>the righteousness of God</i> in
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Cor. v. 21.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are accounted righteous before God <span
class="GutSmall">ONLY</span> for the merit of Christ,&rdquo; says
our church: and so saith the scripture.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is
<i>none other</i> name under heaven given among men whereby we
must be saved,&rdquo; Acts, iv. 12.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will make
mention of thy righteousness,&rdquo; says David, &ldquo;even of
thine <span class="GutSmall">ONLY</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Psal.
lxxi. 17.&nbsp; To suppose, that any thing but the righteousness
of Christ can justify us before God, is a supposition big with
pride, blasphemy, and absurdity:&mdash;with <i>pride</i>; because
it inclines a man to esteem himself a sort of coadjutor in the
work of salvation with Christ:&mdash;with <i>blasphemy</i>;
because, by implying an insufficiency in the Redeemer&rsquo;s
righteousness <i>fully</i> to justify, without the co-operation
of human merit, it detracts from his personal and mediatorial
honor, and gives a share of glory where none is due:&mdash;with
<i>absurdity</i>; because it implies, that Christ came only to be
a <i>half</i> Saviour; and attempts to establish a coalition
between human <i>works</i> and divine <i>grace</i>, by making
eternal salvation depend partly upon the one, and partly upon the
other; a heterogeneous mixture this, which the scriptures disavow
in most explicit terms.&nbsp; <a name="page382"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 382</span>&ldquo;If by grace, then it is no
more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.&nbsp; But if it
be of works, then is it no more of grace: otherwise work is no
more work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. xi. 6.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; The righteousness, by which we are justified, is
made over to us by an act of gracious and sovereign
<i>imputation</i>.&nbsp; Thus &ldquo;David describeth the
blessedness of the man, to whom God <i>imputeth</i> righteousness
without works, saying, blessed are they, &amp;c.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Rom. iv. 7.&nbsp; And, because <i>faith</i> is the instrument in
receiving and cleaving to this righteousness; therefore this
grace is said in a secondary and subordinate sense, to operate in
our justification.&nbsp; So &ldquo;Abraham <i>believed</i> God,
and it was accounted
&epsilon;&lambda;&omicron;&gamma;&iota;&sigma;&theta;&eta;
<i>imputed</i> to him for righteousness.&nbsp; But, that faith
itself cannot constitute a justifying righteousness, properly so
called, is evident, because it is opposed to <i>working</i>, to
him that <i>worketh not</i> but <i>believeth</i>,&rdquo;
&amp;c.&nbsp; Rom. iv. 5; and because, if it justified in the
proper sense of the word, as an act, our justification being in
that case by <i>works</i>, we should then claim heaven as a
reward due to personal merit.&nbsp; For, &ldquo;to him that
worketh, is the reward not reckoned of <i>grace</i> but of
<i>debt</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. iv. 4.&nbsp; But, that faith
cannot found any such claim, is abundantly demonstrable, from the
distinction which the scriptures observe between faith and its
object; making <a name="page383"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
383</span>use so frequently of the terms, &ldquo;the
righteousness which is <i>by</i> and <i>through</i> faith,&rdquo;
Phil. iii. 9, and &ldquo;faith <i>in</i> the righteousness of
Christ.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2 Pet. i. 1.&nbsp; So that, when our church
says &ldquo;we are justified by <i>faith</i> only&rdquo; in
opposition to works, it means that we are justified
<i>instrumentally</i> by faith, but that the object which it
apprehends, viz. the righteousness of Christ, is the primary and
meritorious cause of our justification.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; The grace of faith, by which we are justified, is
also the great instrument in the inward work of
<i>sanctification</i>; because it &ldquo;receives from
Christ&rsquo;s fulness,&rdquo; grace to &ldquo;purify the
heart&rdquo; and &ldquo;work by love.&rdquo;&nbsp; It cleanseth
the conscience from dead works to serve the living <span
class="smcap">God</span>; and lays the axe to the root of
corruption, by destroying the love, and mortifying the power of
sin.&nbsp; An increase of faith produceth a proportionable
increase of sanctification: for, as the first production of the
fruits of righteousness originates from this life-giving grace,
so the subsequent abounding of them derives its prosperity from
its fructifying influence.&nbsp; And, as &ldquo;works done before
the grace of Christ and the inspiration of his spirit are not
pleasing to God, because they do not spring from faith;&rdquo;
(see the article); consequently, those which follow after
justification, derive their acceptableness <a
name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 384</span>from that
faith, which offers them upon the golden altar of the
Redeemer&rsquo;s sacrifice, which sanctifieth the gift.&nbsp;
Hence we see how a sinner is made inherently holy, as well as
personally righteous; viz. by one and the same faith,
apprehending Christ as our sanctification, as well as our
righteousness in justification.&nbsp; And, from hence it is
apparent, 1. that no good works can go before justification; or
that, until a sinner is made partaker of divine faith, he can
perform nothing acceptable in the sight of God; because,
&ldquo;whatsoever is not of faith, is sin:&rdquo; 2. and
therefore, that he cannot bring forth the fruits of righteousness
in his heart and life before men, until the person is accepted
before God, through the infinitely meritorious work of the
Mediator.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; This inward work of the spirit is absolutely
necessary to the sinner&rsquo;s <i>meetness</i> for heaven; and
the external fruits of it justify his religious character before
the world.&nbsp; Thus Abraham was justified by <i>works</i>
before men, and by <i>faith</i> before God.&nbsp; The intentional
offering up of his son was the illustrious instance of the
strength and genuineness of his faith, and constituted his
declarative justification before the world: but his
&ldquo;believing in the promised Messiah, which was accounted to
him for righteousness,&rdquo; was the ground of his justification
<a name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 385</span>before
God, and preceded his justification by works.&nbsp; So that the
father of the faithful himself, &ldquo;if he were justified by
works, hath whereof to glory, but <span class="smcap">not before
God</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. iv. 2.&nbsp; And thus the
scripture, without incurring the charge of self contradiction,
was eminently fulfilled, when it saith, &ldquo;Abraham believed
God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness:&rdquo; and,
&ldquo;Was not Abraham our father justified by
works?&rdquo;&nbsp; James, ii. 21, 23.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; By this scriptural distinction, every thing is kept
in its proper place.&nbsp; Justification and sanctification are
not confounded; and their respective offices are so ascribed to
faith and works, as that the honor of the one is not vacated, nor
the declarative evidence of the other superseded; but both are
established in their proper stations;&mdash;<i>that</i> to
justify before God;&mdash;<i>these</i> to justify before
men.&nbsp; By this distinction, the word of God is easily
reconciled with itself; and while one branch of it furnishes an
antidote to the insolent claims of self-righteousness, the other
equally secures obedience to the law, against the presumptuous
hope of the antinomian hypocrite.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do we make void
the law through faith?&nbsp; God forbid: yea we establish the
law.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. iii. 31.&mdash;&ldquo;By <i>grace</i> ye
are saved through faith: <i>not of works</i>, lest any man should
boast.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ephes. ii. 8, 9.</p>
<p><a name="page386"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 386</span>From
all, which I have urged on this head, with studied copiousness
because of its importance, it is manifest that a <i>righteous
man</i> is one, who renouncing his own, betaketh himself to the
righteousness of Christ; who, through the infinite merit of the
Saviour&rsquo;s blood, and the perfection of his obedience to the
law, is delivered from curse and condemnation, and is possessed
of a legal title to heaven; who receiving this method of
justification by faith, believeth to the saving of the soul; in
whose heart the fruits of righteousness are implanted; and in
whose life there is a complete portraiture of a consistent
professor of the gospel.&nbsp; Such a man is now blessed in the
possession of present good; but he has secured to him still
greater happiness in reversion.&nbsp; Standing in Christ, he has
nothing to fear from sin, Satan, the law, or justice.&nbsp; And
having his loins girded and his lamp burning, he is ready at all
times to arise and meet the bridegroom.&nbsp; To him to live is
Christ, to die is gain.&mdash;But this brings me</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; To consider the nature and extent of his happiness
implied in the terms <i>entering into peace</i>.</p>
<p>As <i>peace</i> necessarily pre-supposes trouble or warfare,
it consequently leads back our ideas to the state of the
righteous in this howling wilderness, previous to their arrival
at the heavenly <a name="page387"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
387</span>Canaan.&nbsp; Here, as pilgrims and sojourners, in a
strange land, they undergo a great variety of fatigue and
hardship before they accomplish the important journey they are
taking; and one can never contemplate the <i>rest</i> they enter
upon in a glorious hereafter, without tracing in idea the
<i>wearisome steps</i> that lead to it.</p>
<p>Afflictions and trials are the lot of the righteous in this
world; and they are not more remarkable for their number, than
for the peculiarity of their nature, and the end of their
appointment.&nbsp; Though they are sharers in those common and
general afflictions, to which human nature, since the fall, is
subjected, and to which man is born as the sparks fly upward; yet
they have a superadded portion of trials distinct from those,
which are inseparably connected with their character, as
Christians, and with their life, as believers; and for bearing of
which they require a proportionable degree of grace and
consolation from on high.&nbsp; Indeed, those trials, peculiar to
God&rsquo;s people, are not only the inevitable consequence of
their gospel profession, but also the result of divine
appointment.&nbsp; So the Apostle Paul expressly declares in his
epistle to the suffering professors of the church of Christ at
Thessalonica; when, after exhorting them &ldquo;not to be moved
by their afflictions,&rdquo; he immediately adds, &ldquo;For
yourselves know that <a name="page388"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 388</span>ye are <i>appointed</i>
thereunto.&rdquo;&nbsp; 1 Thes. iii. 3.&nbsp; As the great Head
of the church is glorified by the patience and fortitude of his
suffering witnesses on earth; his infinite wisdom appoints the
nature, and fixes the weight, number, and measure of their
trials, in order that he may have an opportunity of illustrating
the power of his grace in their support.&nbsp; And there is a no
less manifestation of mercy and love, than of <i>wisdom</i>, in
the various trials which God hath appointed as the lot of his
church militant.&nbsp; Hereby, he possesses innumerable occasions
of demonstrating, that he <i>loves</i> his people under their
afflictions, and that the severest chastisements of his rod are
suggested by the most tender parental affection.&nbsp; By making
the darkest dispensations work together for their good, he shews
them the determinations of his <i>love</i>, and the wonderworking
operations of his over-ruling <i>power</i>: he points out to them
what he <i>can</i> do, and what he <i>will</i> do for them.&nbsp;
So that their sufferings illustrate his goodness, and furnish the
most ample display of that wisdom, mercy, faithfulness, and
power, which so illustriously shine forth in all the gracious and
providential dispensations of Jehovah towards his church and
people.</p>
<p>Besides; affliction constitutes a distinguishing <i>mark</i>
in the character of the righteous.&nbsp; <a
name="page389"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 389</span>&ldquo;Many
are the troubles of the righteous,&rdquo; says David.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In the world you shall have <i>tribulation</i>,&rdquo;
said David&rsquo;s <span class="smcap">Lord</span> to his
disciples.&nbsp; And, as a proof that neither persecution, nor
any other species of affliction, was confined to the days of the
apostles, St. Paul assures Timothy, that &ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">ALL</span> who <i>will</i> live godly in Christ
Jesus shall suffer persecution.&rdquo;&nbsp; 2 Tim, iii.
12.&nbsp; The world and the &ldquo;god of the world&rdquo; will
ever unite in opposition to those, who have deserted the maxims
of the one, and have solemnly renounced the service of the other;
and because the righteous are engaged in a cause diametrically
opposite to the interests of both, therefore the world and Satan
hate them with a perfect hatred, and pursue them with intentions
of the most infernal nature.&nbsp; And is this to be wondered at,
when it is considered, that the most spotless character that ever
appeared upon earth, was loaded with the heaviest
reproaches?&nbsp; If, therefore, affliction be the path, which
the blessed Jesus himself trod; and if they called the Master of
the house <i>Beelzebub</i>; can they of the household hope for an
exemption from similar calumnies?</p>
<p>As long as the righteous are in a state of nature, so long the
world loves them.&nbsp; But, the moment a saved sinner enters
into the peace of the gospel, in that very moment the world and
<a name="page390"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 390</span>the
devil enter the lists against him.&nbsp; As long as the strong
man armed is permitted to keep his palace undisturbed, all is
peace; but when a stronger than he comes to dispossess him, then
Satan begins to rage.&nbsp; While a sinner fights under his
banner he gives him no disturbance; but as soon as he is
delivered from the captivity under this infernal tyrant,
instantly Apollyon draws the sword, and never puts it up during
the Christian soldier&rsquo;s abode in the wilderness.&nbsp; Then
he prepares all his snares; sets all his engines to work, and has
recourse to every stratagem; in order, if possible, to recover
him, whom he looks upon as a deserter from his camp.&nbsp; He
brings forth his loaded quiver; puts his most envenomed arrows
upon the string; and shoots many a <i>fiery dart</i>, at least to
distress, where he cannot destroy.&nbsp; But the believer having
put on the whole armour of God, receives coolly all the
accusations, terrors, blasphemous suggestions, and discouraging
fears, of the enemy of his salvation, and snaps them to pieces on
his adamantine shield of faith.&nbsp; And yet renewed assaults
and renewed disappointments of the enemy never discourage him
from repeating the attack; in a renewal of which, the world
heartily joins him.&nbsp; While he lived according to the course
of this world, blind, careless, and at enmity with God, so long
no encomium was <a name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
391</span>too high for him; and not only the most fulsome
panegyrics were poured upon his virtues, but blind partiality
threw a veil over his very <i>vices</i>, and would not allow that
&ldquo;so mighty good a man could be wrong;&rdquo; although at
the same time, perhaps, his principles and practice were equally
corrupt.&nbsp; But let this same person, late the <i>darling</i>
of the world, and the object of its warmest commendations, only
be awakened to a feeling sense of his lost state, take but a few
steps out of Babylon; and immediately the note of the men of the
world is changed: their blessings are converted into curses;
their praises, into reproach and calumny; and the most
ridiculous, depreciating, illiberal, and even abominable
epithets, are not bad enough for him, who has avowed
non-conformity to the world, and is determined to know nothing
but Jesus Christ and him crucified.&nbsp; So that, if to these
trials from Satan and the world, be added a consideration of the
still keener ones from the remainder of corruption; with how
great propriety do the scriptures represent the life of a
Christian, as a <i>warfare</i>, a <i>race</i>, a <i>difficult
journey</i>, an <i>agony</i>?</p>
<p>But is there no release at all for the Christian soldier from
this severe struggle with sin, Satan, and the world?&nbsp; Yes,
the same hand that appoints the scene of battle, will sign a
discharge <a name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
392</span>from it also.&nbsp; The day is fixed, when, after his
exit from the field, he is to &ldquo;enter into
<i>peace</i>:&rdquo; not like a coward who flies from battle, but
as a magnanimous veteran, worn out in the services of the Captain
of his salvation; to whom &ldquo;to live was Christ, and to die
is gain.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then shall he put off that
&ldquo;<i>harness</i>&rdquo; in death, which he put on, when he
enlisted as a volunteer under the Messiah; and shall lay down the
weapons of his warfare and his earthly tabernacle together.&nbsp;
His ears shall then no longer be stunned with the din of war, nor
his heart be made so frequently the seat of terror and agitation,
under apprehensions of losing the day after all; but, relieved
from all his fears, and released from all his conflicts, he shall
enter into that land of consummate peace, in his march towards
which he had been obliged to fight every step of the way, with
his sword in hand.&nbsp; There he shall receive, as the
gratuitous donation of divine grace, and as the <i>gracious</i>
reward of his faithfulness unto death, an immortal crown of
glory; which, when his divine Captain places it on his head, he
shall, with the hand of self-renunciation, take off, and in
deepest humility lay at Immanuel&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp; There he
shall be placed at an infinite distance from the seat of war in
this troublesome world; and, beyond the reach of <a
name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 393</span>all his
enemies, shall enjoy peace that shall never be interrupted, and
bliss that shall never have an end.</p>
<p>View the righteous man under the representation of a
<i>traveller</i>.&nbsp; A sinful world is the place, from whence
he sets out: heaven, the country to which he is bound.&nbsp;
Satan and sin are the great enemies that oppose him in his
journey; and many a wearisome step he takes, before he gains the
point in view.&nbsp; Temptations from his own heart&rsquo;s
corruptions, as well as from the world and Satan, are the storms
he meets with in the way; but Christ is his sun and shield, to
illuminate and defend.&nbsp; After having, perhaps, borne the
burden and heat of the day, death at last arrives, a welcome
messenger, to relieve him from his toil, and usher him into his
heavenly Father&rsquo;s kingdom.&nbsp; &ldquo;The rest of a
laboring man,&rdquo; says Solomon, &ldquo;is sweet.&rdquo;&nbsp;
How much more delectable must rest in the placid bosom of the
tomb be to him, whose labors have been great in proportion to the
greatness of the cause in which he embarked! and all the powers
of whose body and soul were exerted in the arduous toil!&nbsp;
But after the fatigue of the day, how sweet the approach of the
season of repose!&nbsp; Even in the prospect of it, the believer
anticipates a degree of heaven; and an <a
name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 394</span>assurance
that his light afflictions will, as it were in a moment, come to
a period, alleviates every present cross, and enables him, in the
view of future trials, to take no anxious thought for
to-morrow.&nbsp; When death actually comes, he finds him prepared
for his arrival.&nbsp; Clad with the whole armour of God, and
washed from every defilement in the Mediator&rsquo;s blood, he
shouts, &ldquo;O death where is thy sting?&nbsp; O grave where is
thy victory?&rdquo;&nbsp; With intrepidity of soul, he touches
the <i>sting</i> of death, and feels it not only blunted, but
also free from poison.&nbsp; He then examines the whole strength
of the <i>quiver</i> of death, and finds there is not one shaft
in it that can penetrate his shield of faith and wound his soul;
and then he shouts again, &ldquo;Thanks be to God, who giveth me
the victory through my Lord Jesus Christ!&rdquo;&nbsp; And as
soon as death executes his commission; that fatal blow of the
King of terrors, which, by a judicial sentence, cuts down the
wicked as cumberers of the ground, and is only a prelude to the
transplantation of the righteous from this desert to the
celestial Eden; his body then drops into its original dust, and
is consigned to the silent grave; where &ldquo;it lieth down and
riseth not, till the heavens be no more.&rdquo;&nbsp; Job, xiv.
12.&nbsp; There the wicked cease from <a name="page395"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 395</span>&ldquo;troubling, and there the
weary are at rest.&rdquo;&nbsp; Chapter iii. 17.&nbsp; Then his
mortal part &ldquo;enters into peace,&rdquo; being exempt from
every thing that could give pain, or cause trouble.&nbsp;
There</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The corpse is affected no more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With trouble, or shaken with pain,<br />
The war in the members is o&rsquo;er,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And never shall vex him again.<br />
The languishing <i>head</i> is at rest;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its <i>thinking</i> and <i>aching</i> are
o&rsquo;er:<br />
The quiet immovable <i>breast</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is heav&rsquo;d by affliction no more.<br />
The <i>heart</i> is no longer the seat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of trouble and torturing pain:<br />
It ceases to flutter and beat;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It never shall flutter again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what tongue can describe, or heart conceive, the nature of
that peace, which the disembodied spirit enters upon!&nbsp; The
instant the thread of life is cut, and the soul is disengaged
from the cumbrous clod of earth in which it was imprisoned, it
flies to regions above, and towers away on the wings of cherubim,
to that celestial city, whither it had often fled before on the
wings of <i>faith</i>, and <i>hope</i>, and strong
<i>desire</i>.&nbsp; A convoy of angels attended till the happy
spirit was released from its prison; after which the heavenly
escort conducts it to the promised <a name="page396"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 396</span>rest.&nbsp; The gates of the New
Jerusalem are thrown open wide to admit the blessed stranger;
whom Immanuel waits to introduce to his kingdom, and clasp to his
heart.&nbsp; Then the righteous <i>enters</i>, amidst the
congratulatory salutations of kindred
spirits:&mdash;<i>enters</i>! through the infinite merit of the
blood of atonement:&mdash;<i>enters</i>! like the weary traveller
arriving joyful, though fatigued, at his journey&rsquo;s
end:&mdash;<i>enters</i>! like an exile, returning from a long
captivity, to his native home:&mdash;<i>enters</i>! triumphant,
as a victor loaded with spoils, and crowned with conquest, after
a severe campaign:&mdash;<i>enters</i>! like some richly-laden
vessel, with all its sails crowded to the wind; escaping the
horrors of the deep, and making for the destined haven, where it
would be.&mdash;Thus the righteous enters, while, we may suppose
every golden harp is new-strung, to shout him welcome to the
celestial city; and every voice is exerted in singing,
&ldquo;Open ye the gates, that the righteous which keepeth the
truth may enter in.&rdquo;&nbsp; Isa. xxvi. 2.</p>
<p>He enters into <i>peace</i>.&nbsp; This blessing was in a
degree the privilege of the believer upon earth, when,
&ldquo;being justified by faith,&rdquo; and &ldquo;having access
into this grace wherein we stand,&rdquo; Rom. v. 1, 2, he entered
into peace passing all understanding.&nbsp; But, as that peace
was constantly <a name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
397</span>assaulted, and frequently interrupted upon earth, it is
necessary that he be for ever delivered from such interruption
and all the causes of it.&nbsp; Such &ldquo;a rest remaineth for
the people of God:&rdquo; where Satan shall never be able to
annoy, the world cannot obtrude its temptations; and sin shall no
more extort that groan, &ldquo;Wretched man that I am! who shall
deliver me from the body of this death!&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. vii.
24.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where the righteous shall hunger no more,
neither thirst any more: for the Lamb which is in the midst of
the throne shall feed them, and lead them to fountains of living
waters; and God shall wipe away all tears from their
eyes!&rdquo;&nbsp; Rev. vii. 16, 17.</p>
<p>What a glorious exchange?&mdash;of sickness and pain, for
everlasting rest and peace!&mdash;of a ruinous tabernacle; for a
house, not made with hands, eternal in the heavens!&mdash;of a
howling wilderness; for the heavenly Canaan, the palace of
angels, the city of God!&mdash;of the groanings of corruption and
sin; for the songs of the redeemed round the throne!&mdash;of the
chamber of sickness; for the regions of unfading health,
&ldquo;where the inhabitant shall never say, <i>I am
sick</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;of the cross; for a crown of glory,
incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away!&mdash;and of
earth, with all its distractions, vanities, vicissitudes, and
woes; for the beatitudes of <a name="page398"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 398</span>heaven, and the rapturous enjoyment
of the vision of God!</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;Happy day! that breaks our chain!<br
/>
That manumits; that calls, from exile, home:<br />
That leads to nature&rsquo;s great metropolis:<br />
And readmits us, thro&rsquo; the guardian hand<br />
Of elder brothers, to our <i>Father&rsquo;s</i>
throne!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it is time I should now proceed to consider the last thing
proposed, which was,</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; To suggest some serious reflections, more
particularly adapted to the consideration of young persons; and
not unworthy, I hope, the solemn attention of the aged.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; You have heard the character, and the blessedness of
<i>the righteous</i>, described: Do you wish to be followers of
such?&nbsp; Follow them to the <i>grave</i> you certainly must;
and it is impossible to tell, how soon that may be the
case.&nbsp; While your passions are moved under a subject, that
is in itself deeply affecting, perhaps you are adopting the wish
of <i>Balaam</i>, &ldquo;Let me die the death of the righteous,
and let <i>my</i> last end be like his!&rdquo;&nbsp; But do you
wish, not only to follow the righteous to the <i>glory</i> that
awaits him, but also to tread that <i>path</i> which leads to
it?&nbsp; If not, your wishes are insincere, and delusory.&nbsp;
The <i>life</i> and <i>death</i> of the righteous will always be
of a piece: if <i>that</i> be not holy, <i>this</i> will not be
blessed.</p>
<p><a name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
399</span>2.&nbsp; But, perhaps, subjects of this nature, and the
scene to which they refer, are too solemn for the gaiety of your
temper.&nbsp; But, O remember, that scene (I mean that of death)
in all its solemnity, will very soon be exemplified in yourself,
as it constantly is, in the departure of multitudes, that drop
beside you on the right hand and on the left.&nbsp; You are
<i>young</i>.&nbsp; But youth, in its utmost vigor, is accessible
to disease; and the most healthful constitution possesses no
infallible antidote against the shafts of death; which make equal
havock in the bodies of the youthful and robust, as in those of
the aged and infirm:&mdash;Surely the sable ornaments of the
pulpit, in which I stand, afford a most striking memorandum of
this truth.&mdash;Death&rsquo;s cold hand often seizes, and
effectually chills the most blooming flower; and either nips it
in the bud, or blasts all its full-blown beauties, just as they
arrived at maturity.&nbsp; How many go off the stage of life,
&ldquo;in their full strength,&rdquo; as the book of Job
says!&nbsp; How soon might the <i>consumption</i>, that ravager
of youth, if commissioned by the sovereign arbiter of life, lay
thy blooming constitution in ruins! and reduce thee to such a
state of languor and debility, that &ldquo;the grasshopper should
be a burden!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yea, cannot death find access to thy
frame, by innumerable avenues?&nbsp; Are not the seeds of
mortality sown in <a name="page400"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
400</span>the very substance of our bodies, and mingled with the
minutest particles of their contexture?&nbsp; So that, &ldquo;in
the midst of life we are in death?&rdquo;&nbsp; Are not our
<i>end</i>, and our <i>origin</i>, <span
class="GutSmall">DUST</span>?</p>
<p>If, therefore, health be so fading a flower, and the young are
no less liable to disease and death, than the aged: is it wise,
is it <i>safe</i>, to squander away your precious, your
<i>precarious</i> moments in vice and dissipation?&nbsp; Can you
imagine that your business in this world, is nothing more than
&ldquo;to eat and drink and rise up to play?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Remember what was the dreadful fate of those who thought so, in
the days of Noah.&nbsp; Is our time so <i>long</i>, that you can
<i>spare</i> such a considerable portion of it to vanity?&nbsp;
Is it so much <i>at our disposal</i>, that we can even promise
ourselves <i>to-morrow</i>?&nbsp; Or, is it of so <i>little
value</i>, that we should throw it away upon pernicious
lusts?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;Throw <i>time</i> away?&mdash;<br />
Throw <i>empires</i>, and be blameless.&nbsp; Moments seize:<br
/>
<i>Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s</i> on their wing.&nbsp; A <i>moment</i>
we may wish,<br />
When <i>worlds</i> want wealth to buy!&mdash;&rdquo; <a
name="citation400"></a><a href="#footnote400"
class="citation">[400]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps you suppose, that youth is the season for gaiety and
dissipation, and mature years, the proper time for seriousness
and devotion; <a name="page401"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
401</span>and, therefore, that you are to seek the salvation of
your soul, only in some distant period of life.&nbsp; But this
supposition is not more dangerous, than it is erroneous.&nbsp;
How do you know, that the time will ever come which you allot for
that great work, which is not so much as <i>begun</i>?&nbsp; Have
you made a covenant with death?&nbsp; And if you should even
arrive at old age; it is ten thousand to one, that your
soul&rsquo;s concerns will occupy your thoughts, in the least,
after a long series of previous dissipation, deadness, and
delay.&nbsp; Does not the want of certainty, therefore, in this
case, furnish a most awful argument against the daring
presumption of your conduct?&nbsp; Besides, why should the prime
of life be devoted to sin, and only the enfeebled close of it
consecrated to religion?&nbsp; Is there any reason, (rather, is
there not the most infernal absurdity?) in supposing, that God
may be put off with the services of infirm old-age, while the
Devil is to be complimented with the blooming honors of health
and strength?&nbsp; Dreadful preposterousness!</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; If, therefore, the great uncertainty of <i>life</i>,
under all the advantages which youth and health can give
it:&mdash;if the importance of <i>time</i>, which surpasseth, in
<i>value</i>, the <i>gold of Ophir</i>; and in <i>swiftness</i>,
the flight of the eagle or the arrow:&mdash;if the great danger
of postponing matters of <a name="page402"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 402</span>infinite moment, to some future
period, which may never arrive:&mdash;if the awful absurdity of
dedicating youth to pleasure, from a supposition, that only the
close of life is to be appropriated to religion:&mdash;and, if
the probability of being suddenly cut off by the stroke of death,
amidst all these vain imaginations; and of being summoned into
the presence of God, before a single resolution has been adopted,
respecting the securing of future bliss, or the avoiding of
future misery:&mdash;if solemn considerations, like these, can
have any weight with you; let me beseech you, to admit their
force, and to obey their powerful suggestions.&nbsp; If you do
not; the time will come, when each of them will penetrate your
heart, keen as so many daggers; and when it will be out of your
power, <i>for ever</i>, to recall the opportunities, talents, and
privileges, which you are now so grossly abusing.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <i>Young</i> as you may be, you are old enough, it
seems, to rebel against God: and why not old enough to begin
seriously to seek an interest in <span
class="smcap">Jesus</span>?&nbsp; Would you wish to postpone your
<i>happiness</i>?&nbsp; True felicity consists in a solemn
dedication of the heart to God.&nbsp; The sooner this is done,
the sooner you will be happy: the longer it is delayed, the
longer you will be estranged from true bliss.&nbsp; Why then
should not your happiness commence as <i>early</i> as
possible?&nbsp; <a name="page403"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
403</span>I know, the blessed attainment will cost you the loss
of your lusts, or your self-righteousness.&nbsp; But, who ever
esteemed it a <i>loss</i>, to exchange fleeting and unsubstantial
<i>trifles</i> for glorious and eternal
<i>realities</i>?&mdash;to give up the <i>world</i> and gain
<span class="smcap">Christ</span>?&mdash;to part with <i>sin</i>,
and secure <i>heaven</i>?&nbsp; Your loss, here, will be your
everlasting gain; and so you will esteem it, when life is made to
appear in its genuine colors of vanity and nothingness; when
&ldquo;the chief among ten thousand&rdquo; is manifested to your
heart, in all his matchless beauties; and when death draws the
curtain, that hides the invisible world from your view.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; But what is it, which the world has to bestow, that
will admit of any comparison with the unsearchable riches of
Christ?&nbsp; &ldquo;The things that are in the world,&rdquo;
says St. John, &ldquo;are the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
eyes, and the pride of life.&rdquo;&nbsp; These are the great all
of which the world can boast: these the sum total of its admired
gratifications.&nbsp; And, when you weigh the entire aggregate of
all its accumulated good in the balance of truth, it amounts to
no more than &ldquo;vanity of vanities.&nbsp; All is
vanity!&rdquo;&nbsp; But, <i>supposing</i>, that the
gratifications of sense and all the pride of life <i>could</i>
furnish a degree of felicity: yet how extremely <i>short</i> is
their duration!&nbsp; &ldquo;The world <i>passeth away</i> and
the fashion thereof.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page404"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 404</span>Ere long, every fleeting object
shall be torn from your embraces.&nbsp; &ldquo;The lusts of the
flesh&rdquo; will expire in corruption: the &ldquo;eye&rdquo; be
closed in darkness: and all &ldquo;the pride of life&rdquo;
evaporate in smoke, and vanish like a dream of the night.&nbsp;
But, the existence of sublunary bliss is not more fleeting, than
the inordinate enjoyment of it is pernicious.&nbsp; The positive
declaration of God&rsquo;s word is, &ldquo;If ye live after the
flesh, ye shall die,&rdquo; eternally.&nbsp; Will you, then,
erect your happiness on so precarious a basis; when misery and
ruin must be the certain consequences?&nbsp; Will you, dare you,
run the awful risk of losing an eternity of bliss, for the
enjoyment of a little transient pleasure in time?&nbsp; Had you
rather endure the gnawings of &ldquo;the worm that never
dies,&rdquo; than deny the cravings of some headstrong
lust?&nbsp; Is it a matter of greater moment to flutter away in
all the emptiness and parade of dress and dissipation, than to
&ldquo;redeem the time&rdquo; and prepare for eternity?</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; If you wish to be in earnest about the salvation of
your souls, let me entreat you; 1. to avoid the company of those,
who, as a color for their profligacy and licentiousness, laugh at
all religion, as <i>priest-craft</i>.&nbsp; Shun the conversation
of such, as you would the <i>plague</i>.&nbsp; Their principles
are supported by <i>infidelity</i>; their practice founded upon
<i>wickedness</i> itself; and their steps <a
name="page405"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 405</span>lead to
<i>hell</i>.&nbsp; 2. Be not intimidated by those titles of
reproach and epithets of calumny, by which, such as dare to be
singular, are now distinguished.&nbsp; It is a fact as
lamentable, as it is notorious, that the power of religion is by
multitudes decried and discountenanced, under the application of
hackneyed stigmas, that have no more <i>sense</i> in them, than
<i>seriousness</i>.&nbsp; But this has been always the
case.&nbsp; When people want <i>arguments</i>, they call
<i>names</i>; and because they have no religion
<i>themselves</i>, therefore they abuse <i>those who
have</i>.&nbsp; Sitting in &ldquo;the seat of the
scornful,&rdquo; they contemptuously arraign the conduct of the
humble followers of the Son of God, because it is such a contrast
to their own, and reproves their <i>ignorance</i>,
<i>carelessness</i>, and <i>vanity</i>.&nbsp; But &ldquo;whether
it be right in the sight of God, to hearken unto such men rather
than unto God; judge ye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Acts, iv. 19.&nbsp; 3.
Beware of despising in your heart or lightly esteeming that
<i>gospel</i>, which &ldquo;is the power of God to salvation to
every one that believeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rom. i. 16.&nbsp; Rather,
&ldquo;give the more earnest heed to the things which you have
heard;&rdquo; Heb. ii. 1; because, a reflection in an awful
hereafter, that the salvation of the gospel has been offered, but
rejected, will constitute the most torturing aggravation in the
miseries of a sinner finally lost.&nbsp; Read Heb. x. 28,
29.&nbsp; 4. Be not satisfied <a name="page406"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 406</span>with a little external decency of
behaviour, without a real inward change of <i>heart</i>.&nbsp; If
you would enter into heaven, you must be <i>converted</i>: and
conversion is a work of the spirit of God, which corrects
irregular propensities, in their very <i>rise</i>: it lays the
axe to the <i>root</i> of sin; so that where this inward
eradication takes place, outward branches fall with it.&nbsp; You
may be <i>civilized</i> and <i>orderly</i>, as the Pharisees of
old were, and yet, like them, be equally <i>unchanged</i> and
<i>unpurified</i> in heart.&nbsp; But, if it please God, to
&ldquo;renew you in the spirit of your mind;&rdquo; you will then
be furnished with an antidote against the force of temptation:
you will he prepared for death and judgment: and &ldquo;whether
you live or die, you will be the Lord&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>

containing Evidences in Favour of a Divine Revelation.&nbsp; By
<span class="smcap">Colonel Burn</span>, of the Royal
Marines.&nbsp; Third Edition, 4s. 6d. boards.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Collyer, in his popular Work, &ldquo;Lectures
on Scripture Facts,&rdquo; has been pleased to make the following
mention of it:&mdash;&lsquo;May I be permitted to recommend a
small and well-composed Treatise, called the Christian
Officer&rsquo;s Panoply, (now called the Christian
Officer&rsquo;s Complete Armour,) written by an excellent Officer
in the Marines, now living and personally known to me?&nbsp; This
little volume is the best compendium of Evidences in favor of the
Bible, and the most familiar, I have ever seen.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The style of writing adopted, is at once entertaining
and instructive; and I never received more of pleasure and of
satisfaction from any book which I ever perused.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Collyer&rsquo;s Lectures</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We gladly embrace the opportunity afforded us by a new
edition of this excellent little work, to give it the sanction of
our warmest recommendation.&nbsp; It exhibits the chief arguments
in favour of a Divine Revelation in a distinct, luminous, and
pleasing form.&nbsp; The substance of it is cast into a free and
interesting dialogue between a Captain, a sincere believer in
Christianity, and his sceptical friend, a Major in the same
regiment.&nbsp; Both characters are taken from the life.&nbsp; We
are glad to observe that the name of the worthy writer is avowed
in this second edition; the first, it may be proper to observe,
was entitled the Christian Officer&rsquo;s Panoply.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Eclectic Review</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A considerable number of years have elapsed since we
enjoyed the pleasure of perusing the first edition of this
agreeable book; it comes to us recommended by a character (Sir
Richard Hill) well known in the Religious World,&rsquo;
&amp;c.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Theological Review</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We find <i>six</i> dialogues between a Captain who is
religions, and a Major who is the reverse; five of which contain
proofs, in answer to the common objections against the truth of
Revelation.&nbsp; In these five dialogues we have met with a
respectable degree of learning and argument.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>British Critic</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This Publication certainly does abundant credit to the
pious Intention of the Author, who, if a Colonel of Marines, is,
to say the least, a very extraordinary character.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Gentlemen&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This Work was recommended by the late Sir Richard Hill,
and we are happy in coinciding on the present occasion with the
Honourable Baronet.&nbsp; Colonel B. has here compiled, for the
use of the Army and Navy, a neat summary of the Evidences in
favor of Revelation; and he has managed the dialogue between the
Major and Captain with great ease, and at the same time with much
effect.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Monthly Review</i>.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All the great, and we need scarcely add irrefragable
arguments in support of Christianity, are here enforced in a
dialogue between two Officers, one of them very seriously
impressed with the importance of Religion, the other a man of the
world, who has paid but little attention to the
subject.&rsquo;</p>

<p>9.&nbsp; WHO FARES BEST, THE CHRISTIAN OR THE MAN OF THE
WORLD?&nbsp; By <span class="smcap">Colonel Burn</span>.&nbsp;
Third Edition, 2<i>s.</i> 6d. boards.</p>
<blockquote><p>Our readers are well acquainted with this
intelligent and pious writer, as Author of the Christian
Officer&rsquo;s Complete Armour: we hope the Dialogue now
reprinted will soon be more generally known than it is at
present; we think the sound reasoning, devotional sentiment and
engaging style, by which it is distinguished, will render its
extensive circulation a public benefit.&nbsp; <i>Eclectic
Review</i>.</p>

<p>Long had the condition of the oppressed and injured African
interested the feelings of the British nation, and called forth
the energies of many of the members of the British parliament;
often had their cause been pleaded in the senate, without
success: but, at length, &ldquo;their cries have reached the ears
of the Lord of Sabbath,&rdquo; the oppressed negro is released,
and slavery is no more.&nbsp; The name of <span

sable sons of Africa till the end of time; Britons will long
remember, by whose patient exertions, (amidst opposition and
reproach,) a disgraceful stain has been removed from our national

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
